This engine has physics support implemented by custom Physi.js library, which is much faster than others. Framework provides extended component control and high frame rate, because it uses WebWorkers technology for multithreading.","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WhitestormJS/whitestorm.js/master/media/art/logo/default.png","name":"WhitestormJS","links":{"site":"http://whitestormjs.xyz/","github":"https://github.com/WhitestormJS/whitestormjs"},"tags":["3d","games","html5","physijs","threejs","whitestormjs"]}}]
