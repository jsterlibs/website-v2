We leverage existing web technologies whenever possible and where gaps exist in support for games, we develop new solutions.\n\nThe engine consists of a core set of functionality that is common to all games and simulations like the game loop, messaging, tasks and timers. Common components like the spatial transform are also provided by the core. More specialized funcionality, like graphics or physics, is encapsulated into engine extensions that are designed to run on top of the core. A common set of extensions is maintained as part of this project, and support for third-party extensions is a strong design objective.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/88a8a16d5a52362a7beeefe6ec65ea99?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"Gladius ","links":{"github":"https://github.com/gladiusjs/gladius"},"tags":["3d"]}},{"title":"GLGE","url":"/library/glge","id":"glge","library":{"id":"glge","description":"GLGE is a javascript library intended to ease the use of WebGL; which is basically a native browser javascript API giving direct access to openGL ES2, allowing for the use of hardware accelerated 2D/3D applications without having to download any plugins.\n\nThe aim of GLGE is to mask the involved nature of WebGL from the web developer, who can then spend his/her time creating richer content for the web.","logo":"http://www.churchofrabbit.com/wp-content/posts/glge.png","name":"GLGE","links":{"site":"http://www.glge.org/"},"tags":["3d"]}},{"title":"PlayCanvas","url":"/library/playcanvas","id":"playcanvas","library":{"id":"playcanvas","description":"Cloud-based 3D HTML5 engine and toolset.
