It starts by tokenizing the PHP code into tokens, which it then uses to build an AST tree. Once the tree has been constructed, the script compiles it into JavaScript that can be interpreted by the VM and then executes it. Any additional unconverted code that gets executed within the VM, such as eval or lambda functions will go through the same process before being executed.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"php.js VM","links":{"site":"http://phpjs.hertzen.com","github":"https://github.com/niklasvh/php.js"},"tags":["php"]}},{"title":"Responsive Img","url":"/library/responsive-img","id":"responsive-img","library":{"id":"responsive-img","description":"Responsive Img swaps out an image's src attribute based on its container's width when the DOM is ready and when the browser is resized.\n\nUsing a PHP file, Responsive Img creates new images on the fly the first time they're needed and puts them on your server.\n\nIn addition, Responsive Img recognizes pixel ratio and uses larger images for Retina display and other displays with different pixel sizes.","logo":"http://responsiveimg.com/images/RIMG_logo_greyBG.png","name":"Responsive Img","links":{"github":"https://github.com/drewbrolik/Responsive-Img"},"tags":["image","jquery","php"]}}]
