[{"title":"postal.js","url":"/library/postal-js","id":"postal-js","library":{"id":"postal-js","description":"Postal.js is an in-memory message bus - very loosely inspired by AMQP - written in JavaScript. Postal.js runs in the browser, or on the server-side using Node.js. It takes the familiar \"eventing-style\" paradigm (of which most JavaScript developers are familiar) and extends it by providing \"broker\" and subscriber implementations which are more sophisticated than what you typically find in simple event delegation.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"postal.js","links":{"site":"http://freshbrewedcode.com/jimcowart","github":"https://github.com/postaljs/postal.js"},"tags":["aggregator","bus","event","messaging"]}}]
