Raptor Templates was founded on the philosophy that an HTML-based templating language is more natural and intuitive for generating HTML. Because the Raptor Templates compiler understands the structure of the HTML document, the directives in template files are less obtrusive and more powerful. In addition, Raptor Templates allows you to introduce your own custom tags and custom attributes to extend the HTML grammar.","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raptorjs/branding/master/raptorjs-logo-square.png","name":"Raptor Templates","links":{"github":"https://github.com/raptorjs3/raptor-templates"},"tags":["asynchronous","custom-tags","html","non-commerce","streaming"]}},{"title":"Web Atoms JS","url":"/library/web-atoms-js","id":"web-atoms-js","library":{"id":"web-atoms-js","description":"JavaScripting is tedious, managing JavaScripts is even bigger pain, introducing Web Atoms, component oriented development for web for programmers with Java, Flex and Silverlight background, they can learn concepts of Dynamic Templates, Hierarchical Scope and Bindings in as little as 24 hours and start creating enterprise grade apps that run on TV, Tablets, Mobile and of course Browser.\n\nWith very little learning curve, it is easy to migrate enterprise apps from Flex/Java to HTML without learning complex JavaScript and unlimited number of libraries with extremely difficult syntax.
