And the best thing? You really don't have to be a programmer to create a trully amazing website!\n\njKit has 99% of all the features you ever need. You don't have to check out dozens of plugins, learn how to use them, only to find out they don't work in a specific browser.\n\nAnd even if jKit doesn't have that one feature you need right now, jKit is fully extendable with plugins and command replacements, all that and your API always stays the same.","logo":"http://jquery-jkit.com/img/logoblock.png","name":"jKit","links":{"github":"https://github.com/FrediBach/jQuery-jKit"},"tags":["jquery","toolkit","ui"]}},{"title":"RaptorJS","url":"/library/raptorjs","id":"raptorjs","library":{"id":"raptorjs","description":"RaptorJS is an open-source toolkit for building JavaScript modules and UI components that function on the server and in the browser.
