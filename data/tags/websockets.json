Models subscribe to changes on specific objects, enabling granular control of data propagation without defining channels. Racer supports offline usage and conflict resolution out of the box, which greatly simplifies writing multi-user applications.\n\nDerby applications load immediately and can be indexed by search engines, because the same templates render on both server and client. In addition, templates define bindings, which instantly update the view when the model changes and vice versa. Derby makes it simple to write applications that load as fast as a search engine, are as interactive as a document editor, and work offline.","logo":"https://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_images/2281739689/pq0xjqy8p0sggqfm3rcy_reasonably_small.png","name":"Derby","links":{"site":"http://derbyjs.com","github":"https://github.com/codeparty/derby/"},"tags":["MVC","nodejs","websockets"]}},{"title":"Holler.js","url":"/library/holler-js","id":"holler-js","library":{"id":"holler-js","description":"real-time, in-app notifications via the command line","logo":"http://bitpshr.info/cdn/holler.png","name":"Holler.js","links":{"site":"http://bitpshr.info/holler","github":"https://github.com/bitpshr/holler"},"tags":["javascript","nodejs","websockets"]}}]
