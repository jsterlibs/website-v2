With that said, it is already employed to operate data visualization for Oracle, Microsoft, Volkswagen, AT&T, Samsung, BP, Bosch, Merck, Reuters, Bank of China, Lockheed Martin, and thousands of other prominent AnyChart's customers including more than 70% of the Fortune 1000 companies.\n\nInteractive data visualization is just one of numerous potential use cases for the powerful GraphicsJS library.
