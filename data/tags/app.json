You can embed generated barcodes into your web apps with minimum efforts. \n\nWebix Barcode includes 3 definitions for most popular barcodes: EAN8, EAN13 and UPC-A. If you need a new type of barcode, you may create your own one by using nice BarCode API.\n\nYou set the BarCode configuration in accordance with your preferences by defining its width, height and color as well as by adjusting the height of its text.","logo":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/378800000054262582/8ea5426795b3d478a4a94426f0ce4b4a_400x400.png","name":"Webix BarCode","links":{"site":"http://webix.com/widget/barcode/"},"tags":["app","barcode","development","javascript","web","widget"]}},{"title":"Build-o-Matic","url":"/library/build-o-matic","id":"build-o-matic","library":{"id":"build-o-matic","description":"Python build script for HTML 5 sites.\n\nCompiles and minifies JS from script tags\nGenerates CSS from LESS files\nCleans and compiles CSS\nLossless image optimization of jpgs, pngs, gifs","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Build-o-Matic","links":{"github":"https://github.com/positlabs/Build-o-Matic"},"tags":["Build","app","html5","python","utility"]}}]
