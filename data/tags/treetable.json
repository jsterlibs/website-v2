This hybrid structure shares certain properties of DataTable, such as filtering, selection by cells, and data export, to Excel and PDF. Like a treeview, it enables data visualization in a hierarchical manner and restores the saved widget state.\nThe TreeTable makes a full range of manipulations on the grid. You can easily edit its contents by clicking on one of the cells, selecting from a list with the help of a drop-down menu, or selecting/deselecting necessary items through the use of checkboxes.\nYou can easily save the current state of a TreeTable in order to return to it later with the help of two built-in one-click functions.\nTreeTable allows you to specify different types of selections with the help of the following available selection modes: cell, row, column, multi cell, multi row, multi column, block selection.\nTreetable allows exporting its data to PDF and Excel file types for further processing. You can also define the appearance of the table after it’s exported by configuring various server-side options.\nWebix TreeTable enables you to make drag-and-drop operations within TreeTable, as well as between TreeTable and Datatable, List, Tree and Dataview.","logo":"http://webix.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Webix32x32.png","name":"Webix TreeTable","links":{"site":"http://webix.com/widget/treetable"},"tags":["grid","javascript","tree","treegrid","treetable","webix"]}},{"title":"Webix DataTable","url":"/library/webix-datatable","id":"webix-datatable","library":{"id":"webix-datatable","description":"Cross-browser DataTable is a powerful JavaScript grid control built with an innovative approach and the latest web development trends in mind. \nIt’s currently one of the fastest JavaScript grid solutions ever created.Speed tests showed that DataTable loads 1,000 rows and columns 10 times faster than other grid libraries currently on the market.\nA powerful and feature-rich grid can now fit in a .js file of 38 Kb (gzipped).\nDataTable supports the display of tree-like structures, similar to what Tree offers.\nDataTable can load data from XML, JSON and CSV files and also allows you to use your own formats of data. \nDataTable provides built-in integration with jQuery framework. \nThe appearance of DataTable is defined fully with CSS, making the grid highly customizable.\nDataTable can be used in mobile web apps that run on touch devices.
