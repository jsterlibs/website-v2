If your code is easily readable you they offer little benefit beyond some nice reporting.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9ceca490600989805d19f5529886aed6?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"Yadda","links":{"github":"https://github.com/acuminous/yadda"},"tags":["CucumberJS","Mocha","Vows","bdd","jasmine"]}},{"title":"Screw.Unit","url":"/library/screw-unit","id":"screw-unit","library":{"id":"screw-unit","description":"Screw.Unit is a Behavior-Driven Testing Framework for Javascript.
