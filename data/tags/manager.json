So you can use Frame to load script libraries from both local and remote servers, cross-browser, with no cross-site scripting restrictions.\n\nWhile many function sequencers exist, Frame.js focuses on application-level synchronous function management, includes a library loader to mix-and-match between remote scripts, local scripts, and functions, and provides a basic set of debugging and unit testing tools.\n\nFrame is like require.js, but designed for the frontend, with debugging tools, and it clocks in at just under 11k (compared to require.js's minified 25k).","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Frame.js","links":{"site":"http://framejs.tumblr.com","github":"https://github.com/bishopZ/Frame.js"},"tags":["application","async","boot","job","library","loader","loading","manager"]}},{"title":"GoldenLayout","url":"/library/goldenlayout","id":"goldenlayout","library":{"id":"goldenlayout","description":"GoldenLayout is a javascript layout manager that supports drag and drop arranging of components, popouts, serialisation and a wealth of other interactions.
