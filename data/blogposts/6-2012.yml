  The year of apocalypse is about to finish. Nothing happened. It was a good year for JavaScript, though. Many amazing projects were started this year. In this post we will go through a collection of the most popular ones based on their GitHub starrings.

  All these libraries are different, but notable on their own. The true leader of list is **Meteor**. They received over 6500 stars on GitHub and over [$11 Million investment](http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/25/andreessen-horowitz-keeps-eating-the-software-world-with-11-2-million-investment-in-javascript-framework-company-meteor/) from
  Andreessen Horowitz. That makes Meteor the promising project in upcoming 2013. Or maybe a most overestimated one? What do you think?

  Most of the projects picked on our list focus on UI improvements. Examples of these include alerts and notifiers. One curious case is **Yeoman**. It aims to make JavaScript development by wrapping together various tools and enables developers to generate a scaffolding for their own projects.

  This was an awesome year for us web developers. Plenty of new technologies appeared and the pace doesn't seem to be slowing down. On the contrary. This site, **Jster, was launched back in October**. We are the most complete catalog for JavaScript frontend development. In the next year we plan to evolve, 
  go well beyond **1000** JavaScript libraries in our catalog. Besides extending the catalog, we will improve the service continuously and make it serve your needs better. Happy New Post-Apocalyptic Year and Merry X-Mas!
