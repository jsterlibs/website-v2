    I'm preparing my next Euro tour right now. The plan is to keep this more casual with time for potential clients. I'll be spending my time in Slovakia, Germany, Austria, and Great Britain and will have time for providing [webpack and React training](https://survivejs.com/training/). A few have booked already.
