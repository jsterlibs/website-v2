    The [Summer tour](https://survivejs.com/blog/euro-summer-tour-2017/) is nearing its end. Only Augsburg and London remain before a short visit to Finland.

    Third tour is already being planned. It will likely begin from Vienna in form of [webpack clinics](https://survivejs.com/clinic/) at [the end of July](https://survivejs.doodle.com/poll/mihayszmt5teb858). A clinic is a supercharged version of [my workshops](https://survivejs.com/workshop/). You will learn a lot about webpack in a two hour intense session as I walk you through my material in a small group.

    I'm also going to participate in [WebExpo2017](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2017/) in September (22-23rd). It's great to return to Prague again.

    PS. There's a [hard-cover Edition of the webpack Book](https://survivejs.com/blog/hardcover-webpack-book/) available now.
