  It has become trendy to write Backbone based applications. But **Backbone is not the only Javascript MVC framework in the
  world**. And as many developers say maybe not the best one for every purpose. You may find it too lightweight, and it may
  lack the features you actually require. For example, you may want controllers and actual MVC stack, UI widgets, etc.
  If you feel like Backbone is not for you there are many other different frameworks worth to check out. In this post
  I will list some of the most popular ones.

  And that's all. It's up to you what MVC framework to choose. At least you should look for alternatives to be sure you found the right one.
  More MVC frameworks can be found here, on Jster. We have more then 20 [MVC frameworks](http://jster.net/category/mvc-frameworks) to choose, and
  even more [application frameworks](http://jster.net/category/application-frameworks), if you want to go beyond MVC stack.
