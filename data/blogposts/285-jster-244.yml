  > There can be only one JavaScript

  [Future Frontend conference](https://futurefrontend.com/) ran last week and from my perspective it was a success in many ways. I also [completed my doctoral defense successfully](https://survivejs.com/research/).

  Since there's somehow less action in the JavaScript space (or I notice less of it), I'll move to a monthly schedule with the mailing list for now. This may also be a sign of stability or shift of focus to AI/LLM.
