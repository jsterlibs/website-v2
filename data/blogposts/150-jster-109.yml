  > Chuck Norris debugs JavaScript code by staring at it. The code confesses eventually.

  [Leftpad 2.0 occurred](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/7olgo0/today_is_leftpad_20_pinkiepromise_pulled_from_npm/) as pinkie-promise was pulled from npm by accident. For this reason, it can be a good idea to run a proxy such as [verdaccio](http://www.verdaccio.org/) in front of npm as it isolates you from these kind of rare disasters.

  We started the sales for [React Finland 2018](https://react-finland.fi/) (24-26.4.2018, Helsinki) and we've almost run out of our early bird tickets! There are also [sponsorship options for companies](https://react-finland.fi/for-sponsors/).

  I wrote [a small summary on 2017](https://survivejs.com/blog/summary-of-2017/). I took my first proper vacation in years so this mailing list was on a brief hiatus. It's back to one post per two weeks again.
