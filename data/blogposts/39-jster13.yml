    JSter #13, and a new year, is here! A lot happened in the world of JavaScript the past year. Let's just say it was a good year for us developers. Many interesting releases were made and the tooling keeps on improving. There is still plenty to do of course. And if everything goes well, I think jster.net will look quite different the next time I write this post.

    This was the first year for us with "Monthly JSter". It's more like biweekly JSter now as that makes more sense for both me and you. Perhaps a weekly schedule would be even nicer? Less content, more often. This is definitely something I need to consider. Also if you have any specific ideas, feel free to contact me directly and I'll see what we can do.

    Remember that Monthly JSter is available as [a newsletter](http://eepurl.com/zB_g5). Our [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/jster) contains some occasional extra content including interviews or book reviews.
