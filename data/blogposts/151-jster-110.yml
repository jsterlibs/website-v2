    > My JavaScript, where art thou?

    [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/) is progressing steadily and we are selling "regular bird" tickets now. We've reached our financial goals. We'll use some for the next year and perhaps meetups while also invest into this year's edition to improve the experience as much as we can.

    I did some traveling during the past few weeks and wrote about [my experiences on ScriptConf 2018](https://survivejs.com/blog/scriptconf-2018/) and [AgentConf 2018](https://survivejs.com/blog/agentconf-2018/). Especially the latter was a great conference to visit, and if it's possible, I'll visit both next year again.

    Friends at [Reason Conf](https://www.reason-conf.com/) just opened sales, so if you are interested in an emerging new language and want to visit Vienna in May, check it out!
