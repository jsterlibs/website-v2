  > A JavaScript. Shaken. Not stirred.

  [React Finland 2019](https://medium.com/react-finland/react-finland-2019-blog-coverage-and-photo-galleries-73ebbbf47d8d) is over and I gathered the blog coverage, videos and photos into a single post for you. The conference was an overall success and it will take a while to digest all the learnings. We gathered the conference videos into [a playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqbOPkCwxlw&list=PL-a9lBflNu2oW1lU7fUvW0oAnbj-mxk2a) you could check out. Now it's time to take a little break from conferences and focus on other things. :)
