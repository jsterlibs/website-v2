  > JavaScript - the language of the web

  In our fourth mini-conference at React Finland, we focused on [lessons learned](https://react-finland.fi/blog/rf-2020-online-mini-conf-vol-4-recap/). The fifth one will take place early December and focus on [React performance](https://react-finland.fi/blog/online-mini-conf-vol-5/).

  In other news, given webpack 5 was finally released, I gave my webpack book [another pass of updates](https://survivejs.com/blog/webpack-book-webpack-5-updates/) to adapt to the changes in the major tool.
