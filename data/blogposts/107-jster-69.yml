    > There are only two inevitable things in life: JavaScript and taxes.

    Things are progressing quite well with my [SurviveJS](http://survivejs.com/) effort. I was invited to arrange a React workshop. As a result I created [a set of slides](https://survivejs.github.io/training/). There are ten themes and each contains exercises at the end. So if you want to pick up basic understanding of React and the surrounding ecosystem, this could be a good chance to achieve that.

    I also published [SurviveJS - Webpack v1.1.0](http://survivejs.com/blog/survivejs-webpack-110/). As usual, there are minor tweaks, but also major improvements. There's more content now and I migrated to a smarter way to configure Webpack. It takes some pain out of the process and makes it easier to maintain complex configurations.
