  > Return of the JavaScript

  I came to a little realization with my [SurviveJS](http://survivejs.com/) effort a while ago. I actually had two books in one! As a result I extracted a book out of the first one. See [SurviveJS - Webpack v1.0.0](http://survivejs.com/blog/survivejs-webpack-100/). You can [purchase it through Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/survivejs-webpack) although there's a [free online edition](http://survivejs.com/webpack/introduction/) as well.

  I still have to restructure the React book so that it doesn't have Webpack bits anymore. The idea is that once I complete this work, those who have bought [the current book](https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack_react) by then, will receive both. I feel this is the fairest way to deal with it.
