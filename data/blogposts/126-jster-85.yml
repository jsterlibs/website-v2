    > JavaScript another day.

    As [webpack 2 is getting closer](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v2.2.0-rc.3), I've been pushing my webpack book forward. I revamped it completely and published [SurviveJS - Webpack v1.5.0](http://survivejs.com/blog/survivejs-webpack-150/). There's still work to do till I can get a paper version out, but this was a nice step towards that goal.
