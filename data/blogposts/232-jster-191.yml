  I'll resume old biweekly schedule with this mailing list for now to see if that makes it easier to maintain. If not, I will revert back to monthly.

  As I run conferences, I have good contacts in the space and this time around I have a special section for conference related discounts. You can share them with your friends if you know some that are interested.
