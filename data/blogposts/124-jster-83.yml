  > JavaScript framework a day keeps the doctor away

  It was another busy two weeks. There were two highlights. I released [Reactabular 8](https://reactabular.js.org/#/changelog). I did some major restructuring there to make it easier to grow the project in the future. [webpack-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-merge) reached version 1.0 as I consider it stable now. I also [wrote webpack-merge related interview](http://survivejs.com/blog/webpack-merge-interview/) that explains the idea better.

  > We are running [React Indie Bundle](http://www.reactindiebundle.com/) again this year. So if you want to pick up content on React, check it out.
