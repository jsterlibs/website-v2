    As usual, time for a new JSter. There's [a new version of TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html) available. I've been playing with the language lately and now it feels like I should have picked it up earlier. Better late than never I suppose.
