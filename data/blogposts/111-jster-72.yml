  > New day, new JavaScript library to learn.

  It has been another busy two weeks. The culmination point of that was a [new release of my Webpack book](http://survivejs.com/blog/survivejs-webpack-131/). I also participated in [a Webpack themed JavaScript Air](https://javascriptair.com/episodes/2016-06-08/) and [Three Devs and a Maybe podcast (Webpack again)](http://threedevsandamaybe.com/introduction-to-webpack-with-juho-veps%C3%A4l%C3%A4inen/).
