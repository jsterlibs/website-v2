  > What are you prepared to JavaScript?

  I recently completed the rewrite of [survivejs.com](https://survivejs.com/) although I still have to write a blog post describing the technical bits behind it as quite a lot of development effort went into the site. As [Future Frontend](https://futurefrontend.com/) (13-14.6, Helsinki) conference takes place in a month, that has been keeping me busy.
