    Things are going pretty solidly with my React book. It reached [version 1.9.10](http://survivejs.com/blog/survivejs1910/) with a nice amount of tweaks. There are still some coming as I want to improve the book while keeping it up to date.

    I gave a presentation about it a while ago. In case you want to have an inside look at what it takes to write an indie book, feel free to go through [my slides](https://survivejs.github.io/how-to-write-a-book-and-survivejs-it). The presentation digs more into the business side of things and it's a side you don't often get to see.

    ## React Indie Bundle

    The bigger news is that we published [React Indie Bundle](http://www.reactindiebundle.com/). The bundle will be available for this week and my book is a part of it. It includes books, videos, and a bit of consulting on the higher tiers.

    If you want to pick up something to do during the holidays, perhaps the bundle would work. It's also a fine present if you are into that sort of thing.

    This is a good chance to support indie work. We even give a part of our earnings to tool and library authors. After all, it's those guys that enable everything in the first place.
