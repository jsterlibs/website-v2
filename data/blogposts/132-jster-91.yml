    > A JavaScript. Shaken, not stirred.

    It was busy two weeks again. I finally managed to get my [webpack book out there](https://survivejs.com/blog/survivejs-webpack-20/) and it is now [available as a paperback](https://www.amazon.com/dp/9526868803). [The euro tour](https://survivejs.com/blog/euro-tour-2017/) begins properly next week. Austria (Vienna) was added to the schedule.
