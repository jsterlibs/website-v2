  > Eight days of JavaScript per week

  It's hot summer but coding never stops. I [went to WorkerConf 2019 recently and wrote about my experiences](https://survivejs.com/blog/workerconf-2019/). If you like JavaScript backend development and outdoors, the Austrian conference is worth a look. If you want to visit Vienna in September, [check out HalfStack Vienna](https://halfstackconf.com/vienna/).
