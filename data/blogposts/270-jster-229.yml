  > That's your JavaScript

  I recently [interviewed Dariel Vila about KaibanJS for my blog](https://survivejs.com/blog/kaibanjs-interview/). KaibanJS is a framework that helps you orchestrate your AI agents. The interesting thing is that it's the first solution of its kind for JavaScript and the approach feels intuitive.
