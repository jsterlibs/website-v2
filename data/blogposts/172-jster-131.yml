    > TypeScript to JavaScript as an airbag is to a car

    We announced [React Finland 2019](https://react-finland.fi/) (24-26.4.2019) recently. It's going to be one day of workshops and two days of conferences (single track) again. This time around we'll have professional MCs and even more speakers than before. It's not the worst reason to visit Finland.

    I hope you enjoy xmas and have a great coming year!
