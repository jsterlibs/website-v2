  > JavaScript - Because you are worth it.

  It has been busy two weeks again. [Webpack 2 reached a final version](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-2-2-the-final-release-76c3d43bf144). This also gave me a good excuse to [push a new version of my webpack book out there](http://survivejs.com/blog/survivejs-webpack-160/). It's getting closer and closer to paper and the end(?) is in sight.
