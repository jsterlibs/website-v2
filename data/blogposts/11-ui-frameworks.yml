  We have been used to the fact that every second site looks like Twitter. That's because of their awesome [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) UI framework.
  We've seen CSS frameworks before, but all of them were narrow enough to solve one problem at a time. Usually this meant a grid layout and resetting CSS.
  Twitter Bootstrap not only provides you with flexible responsive grids but adds many useful components. 
  It's pretty easy to build a prototype site just by adding appropriate classes into your tags and see how beautiful CSS3 magic unfold on your pages.

  From another point of view, a site built with Bootstrap loses it's individuality. When you see Twitter buttons and menus, you can even forget what site are you at.
  They generally look just the same. It's pretty ok, when you do a site for [non-profitable organizations](http://moms.io/) or an [open-source project](http://codeception.com).
  Such sites will look clean and handy without a penny spent on designing them.

  But how to make site look more unique?

  Let's try something different then. There are many UI frameworks available. Most of them are free but some are commercial.
  Some can be great alternatives to Bootstrap and some are targeted for mobile usage. So here they are, with their official descriptions.

  As a conclusion, I'd suggest you to try **Foundation** if you are fan of semantic web and SASS. With 4th version of Foundation you can get rid of style-classes in layout and use only SASS mixins for styling. **Groundwork** was inspired by Foundation but adds something of their own.
  Try **MetroUI** or [FlatUI](http://designmodo.github.com/Flat-UI/) if you prefer modern flat look promoted by Microsoft.
  If you want to have a site look like Jira, try [Atlassian UI Pack](https://developer.atlassian.com/design/).
  KendoUI and IgniteUI are the best for designing native-like mobile interfaces. Consider alternatives and choose the framework based on your tastes.
