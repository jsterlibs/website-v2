  > JavaScript is here to stay.

  It has been another busy month. I published [a new major version of my webpack book](https://survivejs.com/blog/webpack-book-version-3/). Tomorrow, 2nd of December, [React Finland mini-conference about performance](https://react-finland.fi/) will take place.

  We also published a new version of [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/?utm_source=jster), a popular font for coders. At the same time, we made the basic version a bit more affordable while offering more options.
