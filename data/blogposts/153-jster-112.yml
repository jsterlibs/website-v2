  The Spring is coming in Vienna fast. [I visited Concat 2018](https://survivejs.com/blog/concat-2018/), a web development event held in Salzburg. It was a great conference and I'll go again if I get the chance.

  [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/) was sold out. There are still some workshop slots left. One of the major things we did during the process was to re-design the site. [Andrey Okonetchnikov wrote a post about redesigning react-finland.fi](https://medium.com/@okonetchnikov/redesigning-react-finland-fi-7f2dd6b5b487) and [I wrote a React Finland case study as well](https://medium.com/react-finland/case-study-react-finland-website-108a1128a683).
