  > This is JavaScript!

  I've working on a new revision of [SurviveJS website](https://survivejs.com/) based on [Gustwind](https://gustwind.js.org/). This type of work is good in testing framework ideas and fixing oversights in the original design and I think the end result will be worth the effort.
