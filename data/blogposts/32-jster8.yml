  Okay guys. We're going to try something a little different here. On average we tweet around three times per day at [@jsterlibs](https://twitter.com/jsterlibs). Roughly that means 90 links or so per month. That's a lot to click through.

  As a result I'm trying out something a little different here. How would a bi-weekly publishing schedule sound? Then it's 45 links and I have time to include some commentary and there's less to click through. Everybody wins!

  Remember that Monthly JSter is available as [a newsletter](https://buttondown.email/jster). Our [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/jster) contains some occasional extra content including interviews.
