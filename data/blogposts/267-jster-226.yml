  Given there's a lot of hype around AI, I took the bait and [interviewed Janos Dobronszki](https://survivejs.com/blog/singulatron-interview/) over at SurviveJS blog. Janos developed a tool called Singulatron that lets you run open source models easily on your own machine giving benefits, like having completely control over how your data is used.
