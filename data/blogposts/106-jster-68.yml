    Weeks seem shorter these days. Despite that I managed to release a new version of my book. See [SurviveJS - Webpack and React 2.1](http://survivejs.com/blog/survivejs210/) for more details. Check out also the [Webpack book](http://survivejs.com/webpack/introduction/). You can read it free online and a part of the income goes directly to Webpack author to support its development.
