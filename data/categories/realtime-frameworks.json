Models subscribe to changes on specific objects, enabling granular control of data propagation without defining channels. Racer supports offline usage and conflict resolution out of the box, which greatly simplifies writing multi-user applications.\n\nDerby applications load immediately and can be indexed by search engines, because the same templates render on both server and client. In addition, templates define bindings, which instantly update the view when the model changes and vice versa. Derby makes it simple to write applications that load as fast as a search engine, are as interactive as a document editor, and work offline.","logo":"https://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_images/2281739689/pq0xjqy8p0sggqfm3rcy_reasonably_small.png","name":"Derby","links":{"site":"http://derbyjs.com","github":"https://github.com/codeparty/derby/"},"tags":["MVC","nodejs","websockets"]}},{"title":"PeerJS","url":"/library/peerjs","id":"peerjs","library":{"id":"peerjs","description":"PeerJS wraps the WebRTC implementation to provide a complete, configurable, and easy-to-use peer-to-peer data API.

This enables you to easily construct rich, highly responsive user interfaces.\n\nIn a lot of ways, Bone.io can be viewed as a much improved version of Backbone.js. Backbone, Angular and other older frameworks rely primarily on AJAX and model bindings to get data to the DOM. The problem with this approach is that AJAX has no method for handling bi-directional communication. In the world of modern data-driven HTML5 applications, Bone.io strives to pickup where these other frameworks have left off.\n\nWhen we say that this framework is lightweight, we mean it. Compressed and gzipped the entire library is less than 4KB in size. That's less than Backbone, less than Underscore, less than jQuery, less than just about everything.","logo":"https://github-camo.global.ssl.fastly.net/29a4c893b261260a93f1501e54d39674417f40a3/687474703a2f2f63646e2e7465636870696e65732e696f2f626f6e652d696f2d6769746875622e706e67","name":"Bone.io","links":{"site":"http://bone.io/","github":"https://github.com/techpines/bone.io"},"tags":[]}},{"title":"deepstream.io","url":"/library/deepstream-io","id":"deepstream-io","library":{"id":"deepstream-io","description":"deepstream.io is a new type of server that powers scalable realtime apps. it's open source, designed for speed and reliability, offering developers and enterprises all the features necessary to create messaging and collaboration tools; multiplayer games, financial trading platforms, interactive dashboards, IoT technologies and microservice architectures.","logo":"https://worldvectorlogo.com/logo/deepstream","name":"deepstream.io","links":{"site":"https://deepstream.io/"},"tags":["Realtime","devops","opensource","server"]}},{"title":"Vue local storage","url":"/library/vue-local-storage","id":"vue-local-storage","library":{"id":"vue-local-storage","description":"Vue plugin for work with Local Storage from Vue context \nYou can use to synchronize tabs","logo":"https://cdn.rawgit.com/RobinCK/0ef39abfff9a44061cee5b2c072e892e/raw/e2b95a57825ac9b8e845609ff9fc5fdaae37b55a/logo.svg","name":"Vue local storage","links":{"site":"https://robinck.github.io/vue-ls/","github":"https://github.com/RobinCK/vue-ls"},"tags":["Vue","localstorage"]}},{"title":"Featers","url":"/library/featers","id":"featers","library":{"id":"featers","description":"Feathers is a small library that extends Express, one of the most popular web frameworks for NodeJS.
