For example, we get custom event propagation for free by piggy-backing off DOM event bubbling, and our event handling infrastructure works equally well with both native and custom events.","logo":"https://flightjs.github.io/img/flight-logo.png","name":"Flight","links":{"site":"https://flightjs.github.io/","github":"https://github.com/flightjs/flight"},"tags":["jquery"]}},{"title":"Prototype","url":"/library/prototype","id":"prototype","library":{"id":"prototype","description":"Prototype is a JavaScript Framework that aims to ease development of dynamic web applications.\n\nFeaturing a unique, easy-to-use toolkit for class-driven development and the nicest Ajax library around, Prototype is quickly becoming the codebase of choice for web application developers everywhere.","logo":"http://prototypejs.org/images/header-logo.png","name":"Prototype ","links":{"site":"http://prototypejs.org/","github":"https://github.com/sstephenson/prototype"},"tags":[]}},{"title":"Sammy.js","url":"/library/sammy-js","id":"sammy-js","library":{"id":"sammy-js","description":"Sammy's core is only 16K compressed and 5.2K compressed and gzipped.\n\nMODULAR\n\nSammy is built on a system of plugins and adapters .

Use them together as a full-featured framework or pick and choose to build a custom solution.\n\nTwo-Way Databinding\n\nOur technology enables powerful two-way binding to any object. By using adaptive techniques we can select the most efficient way to observe each property in your model and automatically sync your UI with best-in-class performance.\n\nExtensible HTML\n\nAurelia's extensible HTML compiler lets you create custom HTML elements, add custom attributes to existing elements and control template generation, all with full support for dynamic loading, databinding and high-performance batched rendering.\n\nRouting & UI Composition\n\nLeverage our advanced client-side router with its pluggable pipeline, dynamic route patterns, child routers and asynchronous screen activation. Don't need a router but need dynamic, data-driven UI composition? We do that too.\n\nMV* with Conventions\n\nWho wants to waste time writing tons of configuration code for their MV* architecture? Simply leverage conventions to make constructing your app effortless. Don't like the conventions? Plug in your own or drop them altogether.\n\nBroad Language Support\n\nUse ES5, ES 2015, ES 2016 and TypeScript. Aurelia's APIs were carefully designed to be consumed naturally from both today's and tomorrow's popular web programming languages.\n\nTestable\n\nBy combining ES 2015 modules with a simple, yet powerful Dependency Injection Container, we make it easy for you to create highly cohesive, yet minimally coupled code, making unit testing a snap.","logo":"http://aurelia.io/images/main-logo.svg","name":"Aurelia","links":{"site":"http://aurelia.io","github":"https://github.com/aurelia/framework"},"tags":[]}}]
