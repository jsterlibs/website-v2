It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack.

A packaged component can be made up of any type of asset, and use any type of transport (e.g., AMD, CommonJS, etc.).","logo":"https://bower.io/img/bower-logo.png","name":"Bower","links":{"site":"https://bower.io/","github":"https://github.com/bower/bower"},"tags":["git","nodejs","npm"]}},{"title":"Component","url":"/library/component","id":"component","library":{"id":"component","description":"Component package manager for building a better web.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Component","links":{"site":"http://component.io","github":"https://github.com/component/component"},"tags":["npm"]}},{"title":"Ender","url":"/library/ender","id":"ender","library":{"id":"ender","description":"Ender is a full featured package manager for your browser.\nIt allows you to search, install, manage, and compile front-end javascript packages and their dependencies for the web.
