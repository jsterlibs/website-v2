{"description":"Handling Keyboard Shortcuts in JavaScript\n\nDespite the many JavaScript libraries that are available today, I cannot find one that makes it easy to add keyboard shortcuts(or accelerators) to your javascript app. This is because keyboard shortcuts where only used in JavaScript games - no serious web application used keyboard shortcuts to navigate around its interface. But Google apps like Google Reader and Gmail changed that. So, I have created a function to make adding shortcuts to your application much easier.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Shortcuts.js","links":{"site":"http://www.openjs.com/scripts/events/keyboard_shortcuts/"},"tags":[]}
