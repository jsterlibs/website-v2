{"description":"This utility is a base for building interactions. Interactions all have in common a 3-part event model: start -> move(s) -> stop. This interaction base serves as an abstraction layer for events from any input device that allows for movement with such an event model, or anything that could be mapped to such a model. Examples are drag-and-drop (mouse), swipe/slide (touch), etc.","logo":"http://wiki.jqueryui.com/f/1322964934/jqueryui_logo.png","name":"jQuery UI Interactions","links":{"site":"http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/50166448/Interaction"},"tags":["jquery-ui"]}
