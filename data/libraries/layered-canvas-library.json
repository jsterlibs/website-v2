{"description":"The Layered Canvas Library (LCL) is a javascript library that helps manage objects on the Canvas element. The LCL implements a two tier layer manager that creates and contains items within it. The layer manager attaches mouse events to each item contained, and allows the user to define handlers for each event, per item. The layer manager also allows for each layer contained to be promoted, or demoted over another layer. The layer manager, and each layer, and item contained, is defined with a draw function. The draw function executes user defined code to draw the item, layer, or each layer contained consecutively.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"layered-canvas-library","links":{"site":"https://code.google.com/p/layered-canvas-library/"},"tags":["html5"]}
