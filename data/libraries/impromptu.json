{"id":"impromptu","description":"jQuery Impromptu is an extension to help provide a more pleasant way to spontaneously prompt a user for input. More or less this is a great replacement for an alert, prompt, and confirm. Not only does it replace these but it also allows for creating forms within these controls. This is not intended to be a modal replacement, just a quick tool to prompt user input in a fashionable way.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Impromptu","links":{"site":"http://trentrichardson.com/Impromptu/","github":"https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Impromptu"},"tags":["jquery","mootools"]}
