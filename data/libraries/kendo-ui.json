{"id":"kendo-ui","description":"Kendo UI is a HTML5, jQuery-based framework for building modern HTML apps. Kendo UI combines the best of emerging HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript technologies with robust, cross-browser techniques to deliver a framework that is both powerfully rich and broadly compatible with older browsers.\n\nKendo UI combines everything that a developer needs to build a rich JavaScript app, eliminating the traditional challenge of manually researching and combining all of the needed plug-ins, frameworks, and libraries needed to build apps. Kendo UI includes rich UI controls for desktop, mobile and data vizualization, a JavaScript DataSource, fast Templates, cross-device Drag and Drop API, Globalization, Validation and MVVM framework extensions, and more.","logo":"http://jaydata.org/Themes/Bootstrap/Styles/img/logo_kendoui_solo.png","name":"Kendo UI","links":{"site":"http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui","github":"https://github.com/telerik/kendo-ui-core"},"tags":["commercial","css3","html5","jquery"]}
