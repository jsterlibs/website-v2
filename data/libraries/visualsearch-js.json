Specify the facets for completion, along with the completable values for any facet. You can retrieve the search query as a structured object, so you don't have to parse the query string yourself.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/984df9bc1103ee70b636c87f414411a6?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"VisualSearch.js","links":{"site":"https://documentcloud.github.com/visualsearch","github":"https://github.com/documentcloud/visualsearch/"},"tags":["autocomplete"]}
