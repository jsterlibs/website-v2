{"description":"Numeric Javascript is a javascript library for doing numerical analysis in the browser. Because Numeric Javascript uses only the javascript programming language, it works in many browsers and does not require powerful servers.\n\nNumeric Javascript is for building \"web 2.0\" apps that can perform complex calculations in the browser and thus avoid the latency of asking a server to compute something. Indeed, you do not need a powerful server (or any server at all) since your web app will perform all its calculations in the client.","logo":"http://www.numericjs.com/resources/paperplane-small.png","name":"Numeric Javascript","links":{"site":"http://www.numericjs.com/","github":"https://github.com/sloisel/numeric"},"tags":[]}
