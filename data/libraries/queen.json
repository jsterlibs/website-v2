Taking the abstraction further, you can think of Queen Server as distributed execution platform using browsers as computation nodes.","logo":"http://queenjs.com/resources/queen-bee.png","name":"Queen","links":{"site":"http://queenjs.com","github":"https://github.com/turn/queen"},"tags":["nodejs","test"]}
