{"description":"Visual sedimentation is a javascript visualizations library for streaming data, inspired by the process of physical sedimentation. This process is the result of objects falling due to gravity forces, that aggregate into compact layers over time. The process is well understood since our environment is shaped by sedimentation: mountains, hills or rivers are the visible result of this long process.","logo":"https://raw.github.com/INRIA/VisualSedimentation/master/img/sediviz-piechart.png","name":"Visual Sedimentation","links":{"site":"http://www.visualsedimentation.org/","github":"https://github.com/INRIA/VisualSedimentation"},"tags":[]}
