{"description":"Tiny audio library that provides HTML5 apps with low latency audio if available, and falls back to Buzz! by Jay Salvat.\n\nNamed after a wedge monitor speaker that you'd get onstage at a gig, this library is designed for people who want very simple playback - no fancy effects, only loading and playing and looping sounds. It's targeted at cross-platform development, to make it easy to target both desktop and mobile HTML5 apps.\n\nThis means you can write your HTML5 application to play sound using Wedge.js, and if accelerated audio is availble through Cordova, that will be used. Otherwise, it will fall back to Buzz!. This means you can develop on your desktop and still hear audio, whilst still getting the benefits of low latency audio when you compile.\n\nUnder the hood, it uses the LowLatencyAudio plugin for Cordova to provide much more responsive sound than the native HTML5 web audio API.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fdc39f98e3532c2cbf9821de69e06d9b?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"Wedge.js","links":{"github":"https://github.com/boxuk/wedge.js"},"tags":[]}
