It also comes with a JavaScript implementation of the game Breakout to demonstrate using the library.\n\nVarious utility methods will be added to this library over time to abstract away the low-level drawing methods found in HTML 5 canvas. Feel free to make requests to improve this library.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"HTML 5 Canvas Library","links":{"site":"https://canvastoolkit.codeplex.com/"},"tags":["html5"]}
