{"id":"tamejs","description":"JavaScript code rewriter for taming async-callback-style code \nThis package is a source-to-source translator that outputs JavaScript. The input dialect looks a lot like JavaScript, but introduces the await primitive, which allows asynchronous callback style code to work more like straight-line threaded code. tamejs is written in JavaScript.\n\nOne of the core powers of the tamejs rewriting idea is that it's fully compatible with existing vanilla-JS code (like node.js's libraries). That is, existing node.js can call code that's been output by the tamejs rewriter, and conversely, code output by the tamejs rewriter can call existing node.js code. Thus, tamejs is incrementally deployable --- you can keep all of your old code and just write the new bits in tamejs! So try it out and let us know what you think.","logo":"http://tamejs.org/img/temp_logo.png","name":"tamejs","links":{"site":"http://tamejs.org","github":"https://github.com/maxtaco/tamejs"},"tags":[]}
