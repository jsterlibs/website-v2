{"description":"Spry is a JavaScript-based framework that enables the rapid development of Ajax-powered web pages.\n\nSpry was designed to feel like an extension of HTML and CSS, so anyone with basic web-production skills can create next-generation web experiences by adding the power of Ajax to their pages.\n\nSpry can be used with any server-side technology (ColdFusion, PHP, ASP.Net etc.). By building the front-end of your web application with Spry you enable a more efficient designer-developer workflow by keeping UI separated from back-end application logic.","logo":"https://blogs.adobe.com/dreamweaver/wp-content/themes/AdobeDefault/images/adobe_logo.png","name":"Spry","links":{"github":"https://github.com/adobe/Spry"},"tags":[]}
