{"description":"ContentTools is a collection of small, flexible, extensible and framework agnostic JavaScript libraries for creating beautiful WYSIWYG editors for HTML content.\n\nContentTools aims to provide both a fully-functional content editor that can be used out of the box and a tool kit of classes and functions that can be used to build your own editor. The tool kit includes a lightweight set of user interface classes, a set of tools for performing common editing tasks, and a history stack for managing undo/redo. Whilst the components provided by the tool kit work well together, they can also be used or replaced as required.","logo":"http://getcontenttools.com/favicon-152.png","name":"ContentTools","links":{"site":"http://getcontenttools.com","github":"https://github.com/GetmeUK/ContentTools"},"tags":["coffeescript","html5"]}
