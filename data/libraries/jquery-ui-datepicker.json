{"description":"The datepicker is tied to a standard form input field. Focus on the input (click, or use the tab key) to open an interactive calendar in a small overlay. Choose a date, click elsewhere on the page (blur the input), or hit the Esc key to close. If a date is chosen, feedback is shown as the input's value.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"jQuery UI Datepicker","links":{"site":"https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/"},"tags":["calendar","jquery-ui"]}
