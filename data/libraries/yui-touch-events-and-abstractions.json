{"id":"yui-touch-events-and-abstractions","description":"The event-touch module extends the whitelist of DOM events to include the native touch and gesture events and adds relevant information to event facades.\n\nThe event-move module adds a set of abstract events that adapt to the client environment to handle either touch or mouse input.\n\nThe event-flick module adds a \"flick\" event on top of the gesture abstraction layer to capture a user flicking an element with mouse or finger.\n\nThe event-gestures module is a rollup of these three, but will potentially roll in more gesture based events in the future.","logo":"https://ebmedia.eventbrite.com/s3-s3/eventlogos/2254509/828699663-2.jpg","name":"YUI Touch Events and Abstractions","links":{"site":"https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/event/touch.html"},"tags":["yui"]}
