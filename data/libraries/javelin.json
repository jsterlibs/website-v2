{"id":"javelin","description":"Javelin is a large, bloated library with an unintuitive, verbose syntax and very few features. It performs sluggishly and is sparsely documented. You will find that browsing its inelegant, poorly written source is an unwelcome experience. Javelin makes it quite difficult to write code that works on more than one browser. Javelin was developed at Facebook.","logo":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/18a83f753fa76b3ea0d594247f4c93b1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Faff495be3551563209790714027a7d38.png&r=x","name":"Javelin","links":{"site":"http://www.javelinjs.com/","github":"https://github.com/facebook/javelin"},"tags":[]}
