{"id":"sails-js","description":"Sails makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to emulate the familiar MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the requirements of modern apps: data-driven APIs with a scalable, service-oriented architecture. It's especially good for building chat, realtime dashboards, or multiplayer games; but you can use it for any web application project - top to bottom.","logo":"http://sailsjs.org/images/logo_sails.png","name":"Sails.js","links":{"site":"http://sailsjs.org","github":"https://github.com/balderdashy/sails"},"tags":["express","node.js","rest","socket.io","stack","websocket"]}
