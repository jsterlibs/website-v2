{"description":"SoundJS is a library that provides browsers with a JavaScript sound API that first tries audio files with native HTML5 Audio and falls back to Flash when necessary.\n\nSpecifically, the SoundJS API offers the ability to play the same sound file more than once at a time, even while the same sound is already playing. This is also known as multi-layering sounds.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"SoundJS","links":{"site":"http://soundjs.tootallnate.net/tests/super-mario-world/","github":"https://github.com/TooTallNate/SoundJS"},"tags":["html5"]}
