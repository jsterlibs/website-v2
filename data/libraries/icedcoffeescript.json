{"id":"icedcoffeescript","description":"IcedCoffeeScript is a superset of CoffeeScript. The iced interpreter is a drop-in replacement for the standard coffee interpreter; it will interpret almost all existing CoffeeScript programs.\n\nIcedCoffeeScript (ICS) adds two new keywords: await and defer. These additions simply and powerfully streamline asynchronous control flow, both on the server and on the browser. Say goodbye to callback pyramids; say adios to massive code rewrites when synchronization requirements change slightly. Say hello to clean, readable, maintainable control flow for network and asynchronous operations!","logo":"https://maxtaco.github.com/coffee-script/documentation/images/iced-logo.png","name":"IcedCoffeeScript","links":{"site":"https://maxtaco.github.com/coffee-script","github":"https://github.com/maxtaco/coffee-script/"},"tags":["coffeescript","npm"]}
