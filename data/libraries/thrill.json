{"description":"Thrill runs tests in browsers.\n\nOne server captures browsers for anyone in the network to run tests on. Automatically populate the pool using Selenium Grid, Sauce Labs, or Browser Stack. Choose which browsers should run your tests based on user-agent or feature set (anything that Modernizr can detect).\n\nThrill can automatically detect and inject it's adapter during test-time for test suites using QUnit, jasmine, mocha, or YUI. This means minimal or no configuration to run your test suite.\n\nRun Thrill via the command-line, grunt, or within your own application. Use the simple API to write your own adapters and reporters. Report tests using mocha's many reporters, regardless of the testing framework you're using.","logo":"http://thrilljs.com/katana.png","name":"Thrill","links":{"site":"http://thrilljs.com","github":"https://github.com/turn/thrill"},"tags":["distributed","queen"]}
