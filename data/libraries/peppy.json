{"id":"peppy","description":"Peppy is a CSS3 compliant selector engine. This means that it selects Elements from the DOM using CSS3 selectors to describe them. \nI will not cover here all of the different selectors, there is an excellent specification that enumerates them and how they function. I will however, discuss many of them and provide examples.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Peppy","links":{"site":"http://jamesdonaghue.com/static/peppy/"},"tags":[]}
