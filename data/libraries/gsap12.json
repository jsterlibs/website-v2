{"description":"GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) v12\nVersion 12 not only brings more tweenable goodness than ever to Flash, but for the first time ever it does the same for JavaScript too. That’s right. You can use the same animation toolset for your Flash and HTML5 projects. Same API, same user-friendliness, and the same focus on performance and a robust feature set. If you’re a Flash developer, this destroys one of the barriers keeping you from feeling comfortable with HTML5. If you’re a JavaScript developer, this should make advanced animation tasks much simpler and more performant. In fact, it could revolutionize your animation workflow.","logo":"http://www.adrianparr.com/images/gsap12.gif","name":"GSAP12","links":{"site":"http://www.greensock.com/v12/"},"tags":[]}
