{"description":"Davis.js is a small JavaScript library using HTML5 history.pushState that allows simple Sinatra style routing for your JavaScript apps.\n\nThe benefit from using HTML5 pushState is that all of your links and forms can point to real end points on your server, so that if JavaScript is unavailable, or it breaks, your server can still respond to these links and forms. When JavaScript and pushState are available your users will get the full experience.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Davis.js","links":{"site":"http://davisjs.com","github":"https://github.com/olivernn/davis.js"},"tags":[]}
