{"description":"Packery is a JavaScript layout library that uses a bin-packing algorithm. This is a fancy way of saying “it fills empty gaps.” Packery layouts can be intelligently ordered or organically wild. Elements can be stamped in place, fit in an ideal spot, or dragged around.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/8bb81621e78f36a6df9a6e6facf3ccc3?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"Packery","links":{"site":"http://packery.metafizzy.co","github":"https://github.com/metafizzy/packery"},"tags":["commercial"]}
