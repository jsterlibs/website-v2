{"description":"jQuery plugin to translate hotkeys into jQuery events.\n\nThis separates hotkeys from the actions to which they are bound. This way one just needs to register an event handler for a given action and not directly for a hotkey. The association between hotkey and action can later be changed without the need of changing the event handler of the action.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"hotkeys","links":{"github":"https://github.com/panzi/hotkeys"},"tags":[]}
