{"description":"Boxy is a flexible, Facebook-style dialog box for jQuery with support for dragging and size tweening. It differs from other overlays I've seen by providing an object interface to control dialogs after they've been created. And for simple usage scenarios, boxy also provides a jQuery plugin for automatically hooking up links and forms, as well as an ask() helper for presenting multiple choices to the user.","logo":"http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/boxy/example.png","name":"boxy","links":{"site":"http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/boxy","github":"https://github.com/jaz303/boxy"},"tags":["jquery"]}
