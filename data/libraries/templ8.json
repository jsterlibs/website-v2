{"description":"Templ8 as you can probably guess is a JavaScript template engine, with a Django'ish style of syntax.\n\nIt's fast, light weight and unlike a lot of other JavaScript template engines: Templ8 does not use the JavaScript with statement. This actually makes Templ8 parse templates faster than it would if it did use the with statement!\n\nTempl8 does not restrict you to generating HTML. All outputs are strings so if you want to generate HTML, CSS, JavaScript or whatever, the choice is yours...","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Templ8","links":{"github":"https://github.com/constantology/Templ8"},"tags":[]}
