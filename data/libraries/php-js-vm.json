{"id":"php-js-vm","description":"This library reads PHP code and transforms it into JavaScript code which can be run in the PHP VM in this library, resulting in same results as with PHP. It starts by tokenizing the PHP code into tokens, which it then uses to build an AST tree. Once the tree has been constructed, the script compiles it into JavaScript that can be interpreted by the VM and then executes it. Any additional unconverted code that gets executed within the VM, such as eval or lambda functions will go through the same process before being executed.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"php.js VM","links":{"site":"http://phpjs.hertzen.com","github":"https://github.com/niklasvh/php.js"},"tags":["php"]}
