{"id":"whammy","description":"This is sort of a conceptual reversal (or not, this might just be making the description needlessly confusing) of one of my older projects, Weppy. First, what Weppy did was it added support for WebP in browsers which didn't support it by converting it into a single-frame video. This is instead predicated on the assumption that the browser already has support for WebP (at this point, it means it only works on Chrome since it's the only browser which actually supports WebP), not only decoding WebP but encoding it as well.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"whammy","links":{"site":"https://antimatter15.github.com/whammy/clock.html","github":"https://github.com/antimatter15/whammy"},"tags":["webm"]}
