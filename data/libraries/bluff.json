It is designed to support all the features of Gruff with minimal dependencies; the only third-party scripts you need to run it are a copy of JS.Class (2.6kB gzipped) and a copy of Googleâ€™s ExCanvas to support canvas in Internet Explorer. Both these scripts are supplied with the Bluff download. Bluff itself is around 11kB gzipped.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Bluff","links":{"site":"http://bluff.jcoglan.com/"},"tags":[]}
