{"description":"Jamal is a set of conventions and small javascript libraries to archieve a complete separation of html, css and javascript in your web application. Jamal is built on jQuery and inspired by MVC frameworks like Ruby on Rails, CakePHP and its derivatives.\n\nSo Jamal tries not to stand in your way and helps you to organize your javascript code. Javascript code is likely held in functions and used to end up in spaghetti.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e08135b6b8fee45b0f10a61430f73d42?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"Jamal","links":{"site":"http://jamal-mvc.com","github":"https://github.com/adcloud/jamal"},"tags":[]}
