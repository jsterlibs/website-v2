{"id":"touchable","description":"Touchable is a very lightweight (1,96kb) jQuery Class that unifies touch and mouse events over different platforms like desktops and mobile devices with touchscreens (like Android, iPad, iPod Touch, iPhone etc.) The name Touchable therefore might be a bit confusing, cause we actually generate a generic \"Touch\" which involves also mouse events. For convenience they are all called \"Touches\".","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Touchable","links":{"site":"https://plugins.jquery.com/project/Touchable","github":"https://github.com/dotmaster/Touchable-jQuery-Plugin"},"tags":["jquery"]}
