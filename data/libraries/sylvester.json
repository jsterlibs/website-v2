{"description":"Sylvester is a vector, matrix and geometry library for JavaScript, that runs in the browser and on the server side. It includes classes for modelling vectors and matrices in any number of dimensions, and for modelling infinite lines and planes in 3-dimensional space. It lets you write object-oriented easy-to-read code that mirrors the maths it represents.","logo":"http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/title.gif","name":"Sylvester","links":{"site":"http://sylvester.jcoglan.com","github":"https://github.com/jcoglan/sylvester"},"tags":[]}
