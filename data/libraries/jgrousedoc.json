{"id":"jgrousedoc","description":"jGrouseDoc is a tool that allows generation of API documentation from the comments in the source code and does it in the most flexible way.\n\nThe tool allows you to document all the necessary constructs that you might need - not only functions and variables, but also classes, interfaces, namespaces, packages and others. And it does not matter at all which JavaScript frameworks are being used - you can document your code the way you want it, not the way it is being imposed by a framework or a tool.\n\njGrouseDoc produces highly customizable output - you can either apply your own look and feel via CSS to one of the existing themes or create your own via XSL transformations.\n\nNote that jGrouseDoc is implemented as an ANT task, so it could be easily integrated into your existing build processes or it could be used as a standalone tool.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"jGrouseDoc","links":{"site":"http://jgrouse.com"},"tags":[]}
