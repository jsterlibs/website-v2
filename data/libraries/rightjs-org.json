{"description":"RightJS is a modular JavaScript framework. It has a very skiny (15k gzipped) core that has all the standard features, like dom-manipulation, animation, forms, cookies, events handling and so on.\n\nBut the core in RightJS is not just a closed monolith, on the contrary, it is an open structure, much like Ruby or Python. It provides you with an environment and basic building blocks, which you can reuse, patch, bend and hack, making the core itself fit your application.","logo":"https://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRo_p-tz9nPNZgwUJZtw7EuZr2wjZFZl21gZx3Va5n1j8RtB7aBIA&t=1","name":"RightJs.org","links":{"github":"https://github.com/rightjs/rightjs-docs"},"tags":[]}
