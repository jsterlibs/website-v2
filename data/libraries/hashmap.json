{"description":"This project provides a HashMap class that works both on NodeJS and the browser. HashMap instances store key/value pairs allowing keys of any type.\n\nUnlike regular objects, keys won't not be stringified. For example numbers and strings won't be mixed, you can pass Date's, RegExp's, DOM Elements, anything! (even null and undefined)","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"HashMap","links":{"github":"https://github.com/flesler/hashmap"},"tags":[]}
