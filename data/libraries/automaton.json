{"id":"automaton","description":"Task automation tool built in JavaScript. A little detail that makes Automaton a powerful tool, is that every autofile you create can itself be used by another autofile, turning the first one into a single task (imagine boxes within boxes). If you are curious, you can take a look at the source code, and check for yourself that even the tasks that Automaton provides built-in are simple autofiles.","logo":"http://indigounited.com/automaton/img/stamp.png?v=30","name":"Automaton","links":{"site":"http://indigounited.com/automaton","github":"https://github.com/IndigoUnited/automaton"},"tags":[]}
