{"description":"Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is a standardized, high quality lossy audio codec, designed as the successor to the MP3 format. AAC is now one of the most widely deployed audio codecs, and such names as the iTunes Store distribute music in the AAC format.\n\nAAC can be played in a limited number of browsers using the HTML5 audio element, however, some browsers do not support the codec for various reasons. AAC.js enables playback and other decoding tasks in all browsers using the Aurora.js audio framework.\n\nAAC.js is based on the prior work of many open source projects, including JAAD, FAAD, FFMpeg, and Helix Datatype.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c5bfbfedcd54c6e129ef2079df958e46?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"aac.js","links":{"github":"https://github.com/audiocogs/aac.js"},"tags":[]}
