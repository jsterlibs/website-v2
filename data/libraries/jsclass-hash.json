{"id":"jsclass-hash","description":"A Hash is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It can be thought of as a table that maps ‘key’ objects (of which there are no duplicates within a Hash) to ‘value’ objects (of which there may be duplicates). This implementation is close to Ruby’s Hash class, though you may be familiar with the data structure in some other form; Java’s HashMap, Python dictionaries, JavaScript objects, PHP’s associative arrays and Scheme’s alists all perform a similar function.","logo":"http://jsclass.jcoglan.com/stylesheets/logo.gif","name":"JSClass Hash","links":{"site":"http://jsclass.jcoglan.com/hash.html"},"tags":[]}
