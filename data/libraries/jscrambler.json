{"description":"If you develop a security sensitive Web Application we believe that you don't want to give any bonuses to possible attackers. JScrambler enables you to conceal as much as possible, the logic of your application, such as what information is gathered from the user, how it is processed on the client-side, how it is sent to the servers-side. Since our obfuscation introduces a certain level of randomness, it allows you to explore code morphing techniques, which can be vital in precluding attack automation.","logo":"http://s28.postimg.org/3uhgplclp/jscrambler_logo_01.png","name":"JScrambler","links":{"site":"https://jscrambler.com"},"tags":[]}
