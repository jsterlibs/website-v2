{"description":"jQuery getting too big?\n\nThe primary goal of this project would be for the feedback/demand to kickstart jquery.com into re-organizing its code-base so it's more modular since we believe we've proved the most useful parts of jQuery is a fraction of its code-base.\n\nTo this end, follow this project if you want jquery.com to measure the demand for this.

JSLim is another project that takes a novel approach to reducing code size with advanced minification techniques.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"jquip","links":{"github":"https://github.com/mythz/jquip"},"tags":[]}
