{"description":"Polyglot.js is a tiny I18n helper library written in JavaScript, made to work both in the browser and in CommonJS environments (Node). It provides a simple solution for interpolation and pluralization, based off of Airbnb's experience adding I18n functionality to its Backbone.js and Node apps. Polyglot has zero dependencies.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/98b87b3462dcc0f563bf67218951aa79?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"Polyglot.js","links":{"github":"https://github.com/airbnb/polyglot.js"},"tags":[]}
