{"description":"BLACKCELL.js - modern, JS-friendly API for WebGL.\n\nThe project's aim is to give an expressive tool for rapid prototyping and publishing complex rendering techniques. It's ideal for 3D-projects which require low-level API features and commonly used implementation at the same time.\n\nThe features:\n\n\nLinear algebra (vectors, rotations, transformations) and geometry  primitives\nStaging graphics core (designed for custom rendering pipelines and shaders)\nCommon implementations (frustum culling, attributes & uniforms binding,  context lost handling, etc)\nWebGL Extensions supported / WebGL 2.0 oriented architecture","logo":"http://blackcelljs.com/layout/logo.png","name":"BLACKCELL.js","links":{"site":"http://blackcelljs.com","github":"https://github.com/vsergey3d/blackcell"},"tags":["webgl"]}
