{"description":"Intence is a new UX concept and a JavaScript library which reflects the scrolling state in a simple and intuitive manner. It highlights the scrollable area depending on the scrolling amount, thus efficiently explaining to a user what exactly can be scrolled, and is there much to scroll. Intence is suggested as a scrollbar replacament for a general designation of a scrollable area. The library is written in vanilla JavaScript and has no dependencies.","logo":"https://asvd.github.io/intence/intence_preview.png","name":"Intence","links":{"site":"https://asvd.github.io/intence","github":"https://github.com/asvd/intence"},"tags":["UX","navigation","scrolling"]}
