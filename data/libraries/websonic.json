{"id":"websonic","description":"WebSonic Engine - WebGL Sonic the Hedgehog Game Engine\n\nThis is a Sonic engine I showcased on Sonic Retro last year. (2010)\n\nIt's written on JavaScript, and makes use of the WebGL canvas API of HTML5 to draw its graphics.\n\nTo play it, you'll need a modern browser with WebGL support (Firefox 4.0 and Chrome 10.0 are good enough) and a semi-decent graphics card. Just fire up index.html and you're ready to go.","logo":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16053388?v=3","name":"WebSonic","links":{"site":"https://coreh.github.com/WebSonic/","github":"https://github.com/coreh/WebSonic/"},"tags":["3d"]}
