You get new syntax, flags, and methods beyond what browsers support natively. XRegExp is also a regex utility belt with tools to make your client-side grepping simpler and more powerful, while freeing you from worrying about pesky cross-browser inconsistencies and the dubious lastIndex property.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"XRegExp","links":{"site":"http://xregexp.com/","github":"https://github.com/slevithan/xregexp"},"tags":[]}
