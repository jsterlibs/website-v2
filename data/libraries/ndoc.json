{"description":"NDoc is an inline comment parser and JavaScript documentation generator written in Node.JS. This project was inspired by PDoc. It tries to keep compatibility, but has some differences:\n\nNDoc is primarily a CLI tool, so you don't need to code your documentor, although it can be easily used as library.\nClarified EBNF syntax. Definitions now MUST be separated with an empty line from the following comments.\nAdded options for deprecated tag: you can set versions, when tag was deprecated and when method/property will be removed.\nAdded new tags: read-only, internal, chainable\nEvents support.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/52c90cd818a4d6fce7ab419eb2e8a57b?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"NDoc","links":{"site":"https://nodeca.github.com/ndoc/","github":"https://github.com/nodeca/ndoc"},"tags":[]}
