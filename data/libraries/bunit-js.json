{"description":"bunit.js provides a simple way to define unit tests and run them using a web page. In order to use it, you'll likely want to do something like this:\n\nDefine your tests (ie. tests/assert.js) using bunit and bunit.assert.\nImport your tests and bunit at your test main (ie. main.js).\nExecute your tests using bunit. It discovers the tests automatically as long as you import them via main somehow.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"bunit.js ","links":{"github":"https://github.com/bebraw/bunit.js"},"tags":["unit"]}
