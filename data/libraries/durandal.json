{"description":"Durandal is small JavaScript framework designed to make building Single Page Applications (SPAs) simple and elegant. We didn't try to re-invent the wheel. Durandal is built on libs you know and love like jQuery, Knockout and RequireJS. There's little to learn and building apps feels comfortable and familiar.","logo":"http://videoduel.ru/videothumbs/a/xy/asxylJ7SXGG.jpg","name":"Durandal","links":{"site":"http://www.durandaljs.com","github":"https://github.com/BlueSpire/Durandal"},"tags":["MVC"]}
