{"id":"lazy-js","description":"Lazy.js it a utility library for JavaScript, similar to Underscore and Lo-Dash but with one important difference: lazy evaluation (also known as deferred execution). This can translate to superior performance in many cases, especially when dealing with large arrays and/or \"chaining\" together multiple methods. For simple cases (map, filter, etc.) on small arrays, Lazy's performance should be similar to Underscore or Lo-Dash.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Lazy.js","links":{"site":"http://danieltao.com/lazy.js/","github":"https://github.com/dtao/lazy.js"},"tags":[]}
