{"description":"mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript.\n\nMustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code - anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.\n\nWe call it \"logic-less\" because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.","logo":"http://i1-scripts.softpedia-static.com/thumbnails/mustache-js-thumb.png?1347735241","name":"mustache.js","links":{"site":"https://mustache.github.com/","github":"https://github.com/janl/mustache.js"},"tags":[]}
