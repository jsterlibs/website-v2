{"id":"jescov","description":"JesCov is an open source tool for measuring code coverage of JavaScript. It makes it possible to find out both line and branch coverage from any ES3-compliant source code. It is not tied to any particular testing framework, but the only current integration point is for Jasmine. The general approach is based on a JSON data interchange format, which means some of the reporting tools could potentially be used against data collected in some other way than running the core JesCov project.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"JesCov","links":{"site":"http://jescov.olabini.com","github":"https://github.com/jescov/jescov"},"tags":["coverage"]}
