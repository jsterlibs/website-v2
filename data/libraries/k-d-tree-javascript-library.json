{"id":"k-d-tree-javascript-library","description":"A basic but super fast JavaScript implementation of the k-dimensional tree data structure.\n\nIn computer science, a k-d tree (short for k-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. k-d trees are a useful data structure for several applications, such as searches involving a multidimensional search key (e.g. range searches and nearest neighbor searches). k-d trees are a special case of binary space partitioning trees.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2ae539d62625c37ce8c3213eb273a04e?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"k-d Tree JavaScript Library","links":{"github":"https://github.com/ubilabs/kd-tree-javascript"},"tags":["graph"]}
