{"id":"bower","description":"Bower is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.\n\nBower runs over Git, and is package-agnostic. A packaged component can be made up of any type of asset, and use any type of transport (e.g., AMD, CommonJS, etc.).","logo":"https://bower.io/img/bower-logo.png","name":"Bower","links":{"site":"https://bower.io/","github":"https://github.com/bower/bower"},"tags":["git","nodejs","npm"]}
