{"id":"jasob","description":"Jasob JavaScript Obfuscator protects, compresses and optimizes JavaScript, CSS and HTML code for faster download and execution speeds. JavaScript is a scripting programming language used in millions of Web pages worldwide. Scripting languages are not compiled, so JavaScript source code has to be downloaded together with the Web page in order to be run by the Web browser. This has several drawbacks and the most important one is that JavaScript source code can be easily viewed by anyone. All it takes is to open the Web page in the Web browser and to choose option View Source. This means that anyone can steal your JavaScript code, modify it and reuse it for his own purposes.","logo":"http://www.jasob.com/images/TitleJasob_v4.gif","name":"Jasob","links":{"site":"http://www.jasob.com/"},"tags":["commercial"]}
