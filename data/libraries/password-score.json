{"id":"password-score","description":"Password Score is a javascript library for estimating password security in the means of entropy. Beneath using dictionaries the library searches for common passwords or names and scans for patterns like dates in any format, sequences, repititions or keyboard patterns. Based on found patterns the entropy may be used to estimate the time to crack the password.\n\nEstimating the time to crack is still to be implemented. In addition there is still some work to do concerning documentation and the demonstration site.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"password-score","links":{"github":"https://github.com/davidstutz/password-score"},"tags":[]}
