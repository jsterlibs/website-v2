{"description":"Aurora.js is a framework that makes writing audio decoders in JavaScript easier. It handles common tasks for you such as dealing with binary data, and the decoding pipeline from source to demuxer to decoder, and finally to the audio hardware itself by abstracting browser audio APIs. Aurora contains two high level APIs for inspecting and playing back decoded audio, and it is easily extendible to support more sources, demuxers, decoders, and audio devices.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c5bfbfedcd54c6e129ef2079df958e46?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"Aurora.js","links":{"site":"http://audiocogs.org/codecs","github":"https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js"},"tags":[]}
