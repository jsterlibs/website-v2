{"description":"Raptor Templates is an extensible, streaming, asynchronous, high performance, HTML-based templating language that can be used in Node.js or in the browser. Raptor Templates was founded on the philosophy that an HTML-based templating language is more natural and intuitive for generating HTML. Because the Raptor Templates compiler understands the structure of the HTML document, the directives in template files are less obtrusive and more powerful. In addition, Raptor Templates allows you to introduce your own custom tags and custom attributes to extend the HTML grammar.","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raptorjs/branding/master/raptorjs-logo-square.png","name":"Raptor Templates","links":{"github":"https://github.com/raptorjs3/raptor-templates"},"tags":["asynchronous","custom-tags","html","non-commerce","streaming"]}
