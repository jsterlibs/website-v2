{"id":"fez","description":"Fez is an Ã¼ber fast, highly configurable, extremely powerful, and somewhat weird general purpose build tool written in JavaScript. Build specs are created with a simple JavaScript-based DSL. The set of rules defined in the spec is used to construct a build graph which is efficiently traversable, enabling Fez to do only the work which needs to be done, and to do work in parallel when it can.","logo":"https://fez.github.io/fez.png","name":"Fez","links":{"site":"https://fez.github.io/","github":"https://github.com/fez/fez"},"tags":[]}
