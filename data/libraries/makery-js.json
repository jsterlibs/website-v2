{"description":"Factory-style (via blueprints) object creation for tests. Inspired by Ruby Machinist.\n\nMakery is a library that allows you to create objects with default values (and possibly overriding those) via the definition of blueprints.\n\nMakery works really well for creating Backbone models, but that is not the only use case. Makery can be used to create any kind of objects from a constructor.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"makery.js","links":{"github":"https://github.com/leoasis/makery.js"},"tags":["testing"]}
