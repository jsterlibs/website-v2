{"id":"jquery-bullet-graph","description":"A jQuery plugin, turning a html select element into a bullet graph slider. Bullet graphs, developed by Stephen Few, feature a single primary measure, a comparative measure. These measures are displayed in the context of qualitative and quantitative measures. Additionally the qualitative ranges are displayed as varying intensities of a single hue to make them discernible. This plugin creates a pure css based bullet graph and makes the primary measure adjustable by incorporating a jQuery UI slider element.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"jQuery Bullet Graph","links":{"site":"http://johdax.net/post/jquery-bullet-graph/","github":"https://github.com/johdax/jQuery.bulletGraph"},"tags":["chart"]}
