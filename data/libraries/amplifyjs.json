{"description":"Request\nStore\nPub/Sub\n\n\nAmplifyJS is a set of components designed to solve common web application problems with a simplistic API. Amplify's goal is to simplify all forms of data handling by providing a unified API for various data sources. Amplify's store component handles persistent client-side storage, using standards like localStorage and sessionStorage, but falling back on non-standard implementations for older browsers. Amplify's request adds some additional features to jQuery's ajax method while abstracting away the underlying data source.","logo":"https://d2o0t5hpnwv4c1.cloudfront.net/1070_amplifyjs/preview.jpg","name":"AmplifyJS","links":{"site":"http://amplifyjs.com","github":"https://github.com/appendto/amplify"},"tags":[]}
