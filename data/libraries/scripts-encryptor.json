{"description":"Scripts Encryptor is a handy utility to scramble (or, obfuscate) many types of source code files, such as HTML/ASP, JavaScript/JScript, VBScript, C/C++/MFC code. Unlike many other obfuscators it does not employ JavaScript for encoding, which significantly increases the number of web clients that will be able to open scrambled documents without problems. Use this software to compress your resulting scripts, as well as to protect your intellectual property from unauthorized copying and reverse engineering.","logo":"http://www.dennisbabkin.com/php/images/screnc-virtual-box.png","name":"Scripts Encryptor","links":{"site":"http://www.dennisbabkin.com/screnc/"},"tags":["commercial"]}
