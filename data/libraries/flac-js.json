{"description":"The Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) is a widely used lossless audio codec, which means that the audio is compressed without any loss of quality. A decoded FLAC stream is bit-for-bit identical to the original uncompressed audio file.\n\nThe JavaScript decoder was ported from the FFMpeg project and the demuxer is based on the original FLAC documentation. flac.js uses the Aurora audio framework by ofmlabs to facilitate decoding and playback.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c5bfbfedcd54c6e129ef2079df958e46?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"flac.js","links":{"site":"http://flac.sourceforge.net/format.html","github":"https://github.com/audiocogs/flac.js"},"tags":[]}
