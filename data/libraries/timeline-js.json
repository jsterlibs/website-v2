{"description":"Create timelines that are at the same time beautiful and intuitive for users\n\nTimelineJS is great for pulling in media from different sources. Just throw in a link from Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, Vimeo, Google Maps or SoundCloud and TimelineJS will format it to fit perfectly. More media types will be supported in the future.\n\nCreating one is as easy as filling in a Google spreadsheet or as detailed as JSON.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/d0d58e6d7a3f9988d022a058db8bb6a9?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"Timeline.js","links":{"site":"http://timeline.verite.co","github":"https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS"},"tags":[]}
