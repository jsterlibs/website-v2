{"id":"joose","description":"Joose is a complete modern object system for JavaScript based on concepts from many programming languages such as Ruby, Smalltalk, Perl and, well, JavaScript. It provides \"keywords\" or \"syntactic sugar\" for class declaration, object construction, inheritance and more. These keywords feel like they become a part of the language and you don't have to care about the implementation details of all these concepts.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Joose","links":{"site":"http://joose.it","github":"https://github.com/Joose/Joose"},"tags":[]}
