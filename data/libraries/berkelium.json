{"id":"berkelium","description":"Berkelium is a BSD licensed library that provides off-screen browser rendering via Google's open source Chromium web browser.\n\nIt takes advantage of Chromium's multiprocess rendering to isolate browsers from each other and can render to any buffer in memory. The user of the library can inject input and javascript code into web pages to control them, as well as listen for events generated by the page such as navigation events, load sequence events and paint events. Berkelium provides a small API for embedding a fully functional browser into any application.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2f1bd4ed4745fc9cf1ef10003ad21948?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"Berkelium","links":{"site":"http://berkelium.org/","github":"https://github.com/sirikata/berkelium"},"tags":[]}
