{"id":"laces-js","description":"Provides the M in MVC, while you tie the rest. While there are plenty of MVC frameworks available for JavaScript, most of them dictate a variety of other application design choices on you. Laces.js by contrast provides you with a Model, but nothing more. It provides you with the laces to tie your model to whatever View or Controller you prefer. It consists of about 600 lines of JavaScript code, including whitespace and comments.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Laces.js","links":{"github":"https://github.com/arendjr/laces.js"},"tags":[]}
