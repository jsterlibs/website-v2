{"description":"A tool for making and composing asynchronous promises in JavaScript\nIf a function cannot return a value or throw an exception without blocking, it can return a promise instead. A promise is an object that represents the return value or the thrown exception that the function may eventually provide. A promise can also be used as a proxy for a remote object to overcome latency.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"q","links":{"site":"https://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/","github":"https://github.com/kriskowal/q"},"tags":[]}
