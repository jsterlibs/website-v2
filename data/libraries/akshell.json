{"description":"Akshell is a site where you can develop web applications in JavaScript and host them in the cloud. The development is easy and the deployment is instant. You don’t have to buy and administer a server or deal with low-level details; you even don’t have to install anything on your computer.\n\nBut what makes Akshell a “network” is the environment it provides applications with. In Akshell applications make requests to each other; they interact just like programs in UNIX-like operation systems. This creates the whole new world: a web application is no longer an all-in-one bundle of code and data, but a part of a larger ecosystem where every member has an access to the information collected by others.","logo":"http://www.akshell.com/_static/logo.png","name":"Akshell","links":{"site":"http://www.akshell.com/docs/0.2/","github":"https://github.com/akshell/docs"},"tags":[]}
