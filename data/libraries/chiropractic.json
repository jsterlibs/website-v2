{"description":"Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine that focuses on diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine, under the belief that these disorders affect general health via the nervous system. It is the largest alternative medical profession, and although chiropractors have many similarities to primary care providers, they are more similar to a medical speciality like dentistry or podiatry.[","logo":"http://www.athensgeorgiachiropractic.com","name":"Chiropractic","links":{"site":"http://www.athensgeorgiachiropractic.com"},"tags":["Watkinsville","chiropractor"]}
