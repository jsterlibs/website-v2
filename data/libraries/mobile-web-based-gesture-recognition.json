{"id":"mobile-web-based-gesture-recognition","description":"Introducing “Gestures”, a proof-of-concept for front-end gesture recognition on iOS and Android devices. Works great on mobile Safari (iPhone, iPad etc), as well as some Android devices that I was able to test on. Many thanks must go out to Powic for allowing me to use the wallpaper from his Tron theme.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":" Mobile-Web-based-Gesture-Recognition","links":{"site":"https://taitems.github.com/Mobile-Web-based-Gesture-Recognition/","github":"https://github.com/taitems/Mobile-Web-based-Gesture-Recognition"},"tags":[]}
