{"description":"Rhaboo makes JS objects persistent, including deeply nested ones. The programmer uses these objects just like normal ones (almost.) It's fast because it doesn't use stringify/parse. It's portable because it only relies on localStorage, things like IndexedDB and WebSQL having no advantage when localStorage is used efficiently.","logo":"https://adrianmay.github.io/rhaboo/logo.png","name":"Rhaboo","links":{"site":"https://adrianmay.github.io/rhaboo","github":"https://github.com/adrianmay/rhaboo"},"tags":["localstorage","persistence"]}
