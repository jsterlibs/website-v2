{"description":"Oboe.js helps web applications respond quicker by wrapping http's request-response model with a progressively streamed interface.

It is small enough to be a micro-library, doesn't have any external dependencies and doesn't care which other libraries you need it to speak to.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"oboe.js","links":{"github":"https://github.com/jimhigson/oboe.js"},"tags":[]}
