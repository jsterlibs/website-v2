{"id":"overscroll","description":"Overscroll is a jQuery plug-in that mimics the iphone/ipad scrolling experience in a browser. The plug-in adds a draggable drift to overflowed DOM elements as well as a set of fading 'thumbs'. OverScroll runs best on Safari 5+, Chrome 5+, and Firefox 3+ but should run just fine on most modern browsers. Below you can find an interactive demo of overscroll in action, as well as instructions on how to integrate it into your web application.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Overscroll","links":{"site":"http://azoffdesign.com/overscroll","github":"https://github.com/azoff/Overscroll"},"tags":[]}
