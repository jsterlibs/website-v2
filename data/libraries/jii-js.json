{"id":"jii-js","description":"jii.js is a new but powerful JavaScript library created to add some awesome sugar and make your functional programming more fun with Ruby and Python flavour. jii.js doesn't prototype native JavaScript objects until you tell it to do so (via jii.proto() method). The power of jii.js is in its flexibility: it can flatten extremely complicated arrays, check if one complex object has another complex object. Most methods are called after Ruby and Python ones so it will be easy for you to get along with this library.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"jii.js","links":{"github":"https://github.com/nthrnth/jii"},"tags":["javascript"]}
