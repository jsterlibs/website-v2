{"description":"OSGJS is a WebGL framework based on OpenSceneGraph concepts. It allows an individual to use an “OpenSceneGraph-like” toolbox to interact with WebGL via JavaScript, and provides facilities for exporting various assets to the osgjs format. The API is kept as similar to OpenSceneGraph as possible, providing a familiar environment to veterans of the library and introducing newcomers to a popular and heavily-scrutinized set of interfaces.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"OSG.JS","links":{"site":"http://osgjs.org","github":"https://github.com/cedricpinson/osgjs"},"tags":[]}
