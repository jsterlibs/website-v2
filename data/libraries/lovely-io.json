{"description":"Lovely.IO is a front-side development platform, which includes a modular framework, development tools, CDN hosting, packaging and asynchronous modules loading with automatic dependencies handling.\n\nThe idea of the project is to provide a full-stack environment for creating easy to maintain and use front-side modules. In a sense it is much like server-side languages package managers, but for the front side.","logo":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4478197?v=3","name":"Lovely.IO","links":{"site":"http://www.lovely.io","github":"https://github.com/MadRabbit/lovely.io"},"tags":[]}
