{"description":"Custom elements are a part of the W3C Web Components specification http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/. They allow you to define and register new HTML tags/elements in your documents. You can then use these tags as regular HTML.\n\nThis library polyfills the Custom Elements API on browsers today. It is a barebones fork of the X-Tag core library from Mozilla http://www.x-tags.org/. X-Tags in turn uses the Polymer polyfills from Google http://www.polymer-project.org/.\n\nThe aim of this library is to provide a stripped down version of the above polyfills, with zero additional weight.","logo":"https://www.dartlang.org/articles/web-ui/webcomponent_logo.jpg","name":"Custom Elements","links":{"github":"https://github.com/oliver-moran/custom-elements"},"tags":["Custom","Elements","components","html","web"]}
