{"description":"Touchy is a highly configurable jQuery plugin. It exposes event data (velocity, etc.) for longpress, drag, pinch, rotate and swipe. Example use cases include preventing a conflict between a drag and a swipe, getting pinch abstracted across Android and iOS, or creating a single finger rotation.","logo":"http://touchyjs.org/images/hot_logo.png","name":"Touchy","links":{"github":"https://github.com/HotStudio/touchy "},"tags":["jquery"]}
