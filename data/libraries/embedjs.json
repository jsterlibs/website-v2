{"id":"embedjs","description":"EmbedJS is a JavaScript framework for embedded devices (mobile phones, TVs, etc.). It takes a different approach than other frameworks by shipping just the code needed for each device. That means, there's less code going over the wire, less code branching at runtime and less memory usage.\n\nYou still get what you'd expect from a framework: multiple platforms â€” one API.","logo":"http://dojofoundation.org/images/projects/sized-embedjs.png","name":"EmbedJS","links":{"site":"http://embedjs.org","github":"https://github.com/uxebu/embedjs"},"tags":[]}
