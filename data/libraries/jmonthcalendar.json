{"id":"jmonthcalendar","description":"jMonthCalendar is a full month calendar that supports events. You simply initialize the calendar with options and an events array and it can handle the rest. The plugin does have extension points that allow the developer to interact with the calendar when the display is about to change months, after the display has changed months and when the event bubbles are clicked on. jMonthCalendar now supports hover extension points, hover over an event and trigger an event like an alert(); By default the events would each have a URL supplied that would link to a details page.","logo":"http://cdn.tripwiremagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/jomonth.jpg","name":"jMonthCalendar","links":{"site":"http://kyleleneau.com/portfolio/jmonthcalendar/"},"tags":["calendar","jquery"]}
