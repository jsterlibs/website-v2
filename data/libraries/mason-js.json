{"id":"mason-js","description":"Mason was created to solve a problem with most grid system currently available. Gaps. When using Masonry, Isotope or any of the other grid plugins out there sometimes your grid will contain gaps or ragged edges. Mason was made to fill those gaps in.\n\nBuilt on the idea of true masonry when a grid is constructed there are bound to be holes, so Mason calculates where those holes are fills them in.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Mason.js","links":{"site":"http://masonjs.com/","github":"https://github.com/DrewDahlman/Mason"},"tags":["masonry"]}
