{"id":"webix-tree","description":"Tree allows you to present hierarchically organized data in a nice and logical manner. With the help of this Webix widget you can clearly see all levels of dependency within the data.\nDynamic Data Loading allows asynchronous tree level loading. Initially, only first-level items are loaded. Then when you open the following tree branch, the ID of the branch is sent to server and the data is dynamically loaded.\nWebix Tree provides you with keyboard navigation and hotkey management, which allows you to make fewer manipulations as you work on the widget.","logo":"http://webix.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Webix32x32.png","name":"Webix Tree","links":{"site":"http://webix.com/widget/tree"},"tags":["javascript","tree","treemenu","webix"]}
