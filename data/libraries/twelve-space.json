{"description":"Twelve-Space is a structure system for creating relative containers for content based in twelves. The system keeps the structures fluid to meet design needs and to allow for flexibility to focus on the context of content not pixel dimensions.\n\nThe structure system is inspired by traditional grid systems but includes layering and expanding, allowing you to go off the grid.","logo":"http://nicetransition.com/twelve-space.png","name":"Twelve-Space","links":{"site":"https://kevinmack18.github.io/Twelve-Space/","github":"https://github.com/kevinmack18/Twelve-Space"},"tags":["architecture","column","containers","css","end","framework","front","grid","oocss","row","sass","space","structure","system","table","twelve"]}
