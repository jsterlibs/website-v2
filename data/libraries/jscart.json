{"description":"This is a modified version of simpleCart(js), the essential reason for a complete javascript driven shopping cart is that you can use it on any website site, especially ones tha don't allow server side scripting like PHP/ASP.\n\nI have decided to branch a copy to google code, to share my tweaks and enhancements. I already implemented coupon code support, I hope to add more essential features soon.
