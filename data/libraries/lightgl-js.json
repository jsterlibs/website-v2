{"description":"This library makes it easier to quickly prototype WebGL applications. It's lower level than many other WebGL libraries and while it doesn't provide a scene graph, it re-implements OpenGL's modelview/projection matrix stack to provide similar functionality. It also re-introduces some built-in uniforms from GLSL (such as glVertex and glModelViewProjectionMatrix) and OpenGL's immediate mode.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"lightgl.js","links":{"github":"https://github.com/evanw/lightgl.js"},"tags":["3d"]}
