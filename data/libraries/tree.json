{"description":"Tree.js, the Javascript Unit testing framework. (Some say it's the best one around.)\n\nTrust: It's an unittested unit testing framework. You can check out the tests in the test folder, and run them if you will. If you still manage to find a bug in spite all this effort, I'd love to pull your proposed test cases/asserts maybe along with the fixed code itself.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Tree","links":{"site":"https://github.com/Wizek/Tree#readme","github":"https://github.com/Wizek/Tree"},"tags":["unit"]}
