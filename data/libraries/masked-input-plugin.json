{"description":"This is a masked input plugin for the jQuery javascript library. It allows a user to more easily enter fixed width input where you would like them to enter the data in a certain format (dates,phone numbers, etc). It has been tested on Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Chrome. A mask is defined by a format made up of mask literals and mask definitions. Any character not in the definitions list below is considered a mask literal. Mask literals will be automatically entered for the user as they type and will not be able to be removed by the user.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Masked Input Plugin","links":{"site":"http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/","github":"https://github.com/digitalBush/jquery.maskedinput"},"tags":["validation"]}
