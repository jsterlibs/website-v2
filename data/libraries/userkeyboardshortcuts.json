{"id":"userkeyboardshortcuts","description":"UserKeyboardShortcuts is a refactor of the Keyboard class provided by mootools-more. It makes it easy for you to provide local user-customizable keyboard shortcuts for your users that you don't have to care about.\n\nYou just use Keyboard.addShortcuts (provided by Keyboard.Extras) as you usually would, then the user can change the keys to their liking. The assignments they make will be stored using localStorage (failing that a cookie) and will be restored on each subsequent page load.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"UserKeyboardShortcuts","links":{"github":"https://github.com/re5et/UserKeyboardShortcuts"},"tags":[]}
