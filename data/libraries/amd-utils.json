{"id":"amd-utils","description":"MOUT is a collection of modular JavaScript utilities that can be used in the browser as AMD modules or on node.js. - modules are converted into node.js format during npm publish using nodefy - It provides many helper methods similar to those found on other languages standard libraries (ie. Python, Ruby, PHP)\n\nThe biggest difference between other existing solutions is that you can choose to load only the modules/functions that you need, no extra overhead or complex build systems required. It also provides a clean and consitent API and normalizes the behavior across multiple browsers/environments. All batteries included.","logo":"http://moutjs.com/logo.png","name":"mout","links":{"site":"http://moutjs.com/","github":"https://github.com/mout/mout"},"tags":["amd","math","string"]}
