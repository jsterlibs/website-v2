APIs built on Deployd allow phones, tablets, browsers, and any other client, to query, update, and sync your apps data. Unlike working with a traditional backend, there's no boilerplate, or configuration. Deployd works right out of the box.","logo":"http://deployd.com/img/logo.png","name":"Deployd","links":{"site":"http://www.deployd.com","github":"https://github.com/deployd/deployd"},"tags":["api","backend","rest","restful"]}
