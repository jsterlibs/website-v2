{"description":"Responsive Img swaps out an image's src attribute based on its container's width when the DOM is ready and when the browser is resized.\n\nUsing a PHP file, Responsive Img creates new images on the fly the first time they're needed and puts them on your server.\n\nIn addition, Responsive Img recognizes pixel ratio and uses larger images for Retina display and other displays with different pixel sizes.","logo":"http://responsiveimg.com/images/RIMG_logo_greyBG.png","name":"Responsive Img","links":{"github":"https://github.com/drewbrolik/Responsive-Img"},"tags":["image","jquery","php"]}
