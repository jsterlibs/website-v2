{"id":"serenade-js","description":"Serenade.js is yet another MVC client side JavaScript framework. Why do we indulge in recreating the wheel? We believe that Serenade.js more closely follows the ideas of classical MVC than competing frameworks and has a number of other advantages as well:\n\nClean, simple and logic less template language\nData bindings keep your views up-to-date without any extra work\nPowerful caching features\nAbsolutely no dependencies, everything works without jQuery\nNo need to inherit from base classes anywhere (though you can if you want)","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/60e121dbdab3d8d697520483a3413a4a?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"Serenade.js","links":{"site":"http://serenadejs.org","github":"https://github.com/elabs/serenade.js"},"tags":[]}
