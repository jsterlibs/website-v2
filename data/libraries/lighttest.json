{"id":"lighttest","description":"Lighttest is a JavaScript unit-testing library â€” it works both in browsers and under Node.js, supports flow control, and is focused on keeping the tests clear. This is achieved with a minimal syntax of the test cases, and the only testing function, lighttest.check(), used to indicate a success or a failure. As shown in the documentation, any testing behaviour could be implemented using that function and the native means of JavaScript. As result, one can easily understand or prepare the exact process performed by a test without a need to involve some additional testing API.","logo":"https://asvd.github.io/lighttest/logo_jster.png","name":"Lighttest","links":{"site":"https://asvd.github.io/lighttest","github":"https://github.com/asvd/lighttest"},"tags":[]}
