{"description":"Thulium (Tm) is a templating engine written in javascript. It's based on EJS, but attempts to solve several problems with it: It formalizes the syntax, makes it fast and attempts to make it more debuggable.\n\nThis was a result of the EJS implementation being in dire need of performance, specification and debuggability. It works on the browser and in your server!","logo":"https://freshout-dev.github.io/thulium/img/tm.png","name":"Thulium","links":{"github":"https://github.com/freshout-dev/thulium"},"tags":[]}
