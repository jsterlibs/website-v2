{"id":"lazyload","description":"LazyLoad is a tiny (only 966 bytes minified and gzipped), dependency-free JavaScript utility that makes it super easy to load external JavaScript and CSS files on demand.\n\nWhenever possible, LazyLoad will automatically load resources in parallel while ensuring execution order when you specify an array of URLs to load. In browsers that don't preserve the execution order of asynchronously-loaded scripts, LazyLoad will safely load the scripts sequentially.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"LazyLoad","links":{"github":"https://github.com/rgrove/lazyload/"},"tags":[]}
