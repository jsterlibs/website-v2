{"description":"Infusion is a different kind of application framework, created by a different kind of community. Built on top of jQuery, it includes a powerful Inversion of Control (IoC) system for creating highly flexible applications. Built specifically with usability and accessibility in mind, Infusion radically reinvents the role of a JavaScript framework. No black boxes: everything in Infusion is designed to be modified, reworked, and adapted to suit your—and your users—needs.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/fd3ad1ce8ff7c4c8da53aaa62c5a4403?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"Infusion","links":{"site":"http://fluidproject.org/products/infusion/","github":"https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion"},"tags":["IoC","accessibility","jquery","usability"]}
