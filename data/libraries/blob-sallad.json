{"description":"Blob Sallad â€“ canvas tag and JavaScript physics simulation experiment\n\nBlob Sallad is a small demo I put together using the canvas tag, which modern browsers have started to support in recent versions (eg Opera 9.x and Firefox 2.x,) and some JavaScript physics simulation. The main inspiration was the game Loco Rocco, and after reading an article about game character physics by Thomas Jacobsen. I decided I could use similar techniques for blob simulation.\nYou can download the source code to play around with at http://blobsallad.se/blobsallad.js.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Blob Sallad","links":{"site":"http://blobsallad.se/"},"tags":[]}
