{"id":"bone-io","description":"Bone.io allows you to build realtime HTML5 apps using websockets to deliver \"hot\" data to the browser. This enables you to easily construct rich, highly responsive user interfaces.\n\nIn a lot of ways, Bone.io can be viewed as a much improved version of Backbone.js. Backbone, Angular and other older frameworks rely primarily on AJAX and model bindings to get data to the DOM. The problem with this approach is that AJAX has no method for handling bi-directional communication. In the world of modern data-driven HTML5 applications, Bone.io strives to pickup where these other frameworks have left off.\n\nWhen we say that this framework is lightweight, we mean it. Compressed and gzipped the entire library is less than 4KB in size. That's less than Backbone, less than Underscore, less than jQuery, less than just about everything.","logo":"https://github-camo.global.ssl.fastly.net/29a4c893b261260a93f1501e54d39674417f40a3/687474703a2f2f63646e2e7465636870696e65732e696f2f626f6e652d696f2d6769746875622e706e67","name":"Bone.io","links":{"site":"http://bone.io/","github":"https://github.com/techpines/bone.io"},"tags":[]}
