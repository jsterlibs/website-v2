{"description":"Ext JS 4 is a major step forward for web application development. Building on Ext JS 3.3, our latest release adds over 350 new APIs, 50 new classes, and 65% more documentation. Ext JS 4 also brings an entirely new data package that enables developers to use a model-view-controller architecture when building their app. The new MVC enables apps to leverage features like Infinite Scrolling a Grid to build an entirely new level of interactivity in to web apps.","logo":"http://www.sencha.com/img/sencha-large.png","name":"ExtJS","links":{"site":"http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/"},"tags":["extjs","sencha"]}
