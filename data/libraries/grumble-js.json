{"description":"grumble.js provides special tooltips without the usual limitations of north/east/south/west positioning. \n\nA grumble can be rotated around a given element at any angle, all 360 degrees. Any distance can be specified. Any CSS style can be applied. There's auto-magic size adjustment for use with localised text. FX queues for animating multiple grumbles. And it works in IE6+, and modern browsers.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"grumble.js","links":{"site":"https://jamescryer.github.com/grumble.js/","github":"https://github.com/jamescryer/grumble.js"},"tags":["css3","tooltip"]}
