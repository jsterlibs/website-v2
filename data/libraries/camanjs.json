{"description":"The main focus of CamanJS is manipulating images using the HTML5 canvas and Javascript. It's a combination of a simple-to-use interface with advanced and efficient image/canvas editing techniques. It is also completely library independent and can be safely used next to jQuery, YUI, Scriptaculous, MooTools, etc.","logo":"https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/912eac2ec4d92f9ac40e18c42723ab58769875ca/687474703a2f2f63616d616e6a732e636f6d2f696d67732f6c6f676f2e706e67","name":"CamanJS","links":{"site":"http://camanjs.com","github":"https://github.com/meltingice/CamanJS"},"tags":["coffeescript"]}
