{"description":"The Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) is an audio codec developed by Apple and included in the original iPod. ALAC is a data compression method which reduces the size of audio files with no loss of information. A decoded ALAC stream is bit-for-bit identical to the original uncompressed audio file.\n\nThe original encoder and decoder were open sourced by Apple, and this is a port of the decoder to CoffeeScript so that ALAC files can be played in the browser.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c5bfbfedcd54c6e129ef2079df958e46?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"alac.js","links":{"site":"http://audiocogs.org/codecs/alac/","github":"https://github.com/audiocogs/alac.js"},"tags":[]}
