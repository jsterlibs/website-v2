{"id":"enyojs","description":"At the heart of Enyo is a simple but powerful encapsulation model, which helps you factor application functionality into self-contained building blocks that are easy to reuse and maintain.\n\nEach piece of an Enyo application is a Component, and Components are constructed out of other Components.\n\nFor example, it’s easy to combine an  tag and a  tag into a LabeledInput Component, which you can use (and reuse) as one atomic piece. But that’s just the beginning. Larger pieces of functionality — a color picker, a fancy report generator, or an entire painting application — can also be packaged as reusable components.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/70103c13ada6801c095816e50198045c?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"EnyoJS ","links":{"github":"https://github.com/enyojs/enyo"},"tags":[]}
