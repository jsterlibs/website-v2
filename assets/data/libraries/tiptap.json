{"id":"tiptap","description":"TipTap is a javascript library to ease mouse and touch complex gestures definition and management on HTML DOM elements (so, though not tested, on SVG and Canvas too), as well as to provide a unified way of managing different input devices systems: mouse, touch systems and their specific data structure (iOS, Android, Windows...), Leap Motion hopefully, etc. In fact, it's mostly a present & future based library, mostly aimed at multi-pointers interactivity, instead of our old-fashioned and already outdated mouse. But it of course supports mouse!","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"TipTap","links":{"github":"https://github.com/marcbourlon/TipTap"},"tags":[]}
