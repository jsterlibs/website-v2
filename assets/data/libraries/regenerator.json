{"id":"regenerator","description":"This package implements a fully-functional source transformation that takes the proposed syntax for generators/yield from future versions of JS (ECMAScript6 or ES6, experimentally implemented in Node.js v0.11) and spits out efficient JS-of-today (ES5) that behaves the same way.\n\nA small runtime library (less than 1KB compressed) is required to provide the wrapGenerator function. You can install it either as a CommonJS module or as a standalone .js file, whichever you prefer.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/18a83f753fa76b3ea0d594247f4c93b1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Faff495be3551563209790714027a7d38.png&r=x","name":"regenerator","links":{"site":"https://facebook.github.io/regenerator/","github":"https://github.com/facebook/regenerator"},"tags":[]}
