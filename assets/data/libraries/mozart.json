{"id":"mozart","description":"Mozart isn't a library that just handles rendering, a microframework that needs other libraries to boot, or a set of coupled tools. Mozart is an all-singing, all-dancing platform designed with one purpose in mind: To help you develop fast, rich and beautiful applications in minutes, not after you've got tens of disparate components to play nice together. Having said that, Mozart is modular - its default configuration contains all you will need to get going immediately, but if you want to integrate your favourite tool or framework you'll find it as friendly as it is complete.","logo":"http://www.mozart.io/img/hero.png","name":"Mozart","links":{"site":"http://mozart.io","github":"https://github.com/bigcommerce/mozart"},"tags":[]}
