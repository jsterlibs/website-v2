{"id":"anvil-js","description":"A continuous integration tool for javascript, css and html. Anvil started as a way to build a single javascript module from several source files. Build tools that require a lot of explicit/declarative instructions distract from getting work on the project done. Anvil has been rewritten as a general build system with a plugin architecture. It should be easy to add features or change almost any behavior as needed.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/459dfac9a700e57877ef0d0a5c57de8b?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"Anvil.js","links":{"site":"http://anviljs.com","github":"https://github.com/anviljs/anvil.js"},"tags":[]}
