{"id":"webglu","description":"WebGLU is both a set of low-level utilities and a high-level\nengine for developing WebGL based applications. \n\nWebGLU is designed such that a developer can focus on the \nend result with a minimum of fuss and code, but doesn't hand\nhold developers who want more control. This is achieved by \nexposing the raw GL object and also many lower-level \nfunctions for working with it and the WebGL API.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"WebGLU","links":{"site":"https://bjartr.blogspot.com","github":"https://github.com/OneGeek/WebGLU"},"tags":["3d","shaders","webgl"]}
