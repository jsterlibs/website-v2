{"id":"ender","description":"Ender is a full featured package manager for your browser.\nIt allows you to search, install, manage, and compile front-end javascript packages and their dependencies for the web. We like to think of it as NPM's little sister.\n\nEnder is not a JavaScript library.\nIt's not a jQuery replacement. It's not even a static asset. It's a tool for making the consumption of front-end javascript packages dead simple and incredibly powerful.","logo":"http://webification.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ender.png","name":"Ender","links":{"site":"http://ender.jit.su","github":"https://github.com/ender-js/Ender"},"tags":[]}
