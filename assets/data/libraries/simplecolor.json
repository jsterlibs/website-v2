{"id":"simplecolor","description":"jQuery Simple Color is a very simple color-picker plugin that displays a square grid of selectable colors. I found a lot of the other color-picker plugins quite heavy, so I ended up writing this to provide a dead-simple alternative. The list of colors it uses can be customized, and the layout size etc can be configured to a certain extent.","logo":"http://recursive-design.com/images/projects/jquery-simple-color/Simple_Color_Open.png","name":"SimpleColor","links":{"site":"http://recursive-design.com/projects/jquery-simple-color/","github":"https://github.com/recurser/jquery-simple-color"},"tags":["colorpicker","jquery"]}
