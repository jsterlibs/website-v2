{"id":"node-png","description":"This is a node.js module, writen in C++, that uses libpng to produce a PNG\nimage (in memory) from RGB or RGBA buffers.\n\nThe module exports three objects: Png, FixedPngStack and DynamicPngStack.\n\nThe Png object is for creating PNG images from an RGB or RGBA buffer.\nThe FixedPngStack is for joining a number of PNGs together (stacking them\ntogether) on a transparent blackground.\nThe DynamicPngStack is for joining a number of PNGs together in the most\nspace efficient way (so that the canvas border matches the leftmost upper corner\nof some PNG and the rightmost bottom corner of some PNG).","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"node-png","links":{"site":"http://www.catonmat.net","github":"https://github.com/pkrumins/node-png"},"tags":[]}
