{"id":"bookblock","description":"BookBlock is a jQuery plugin that can be used for creating booklet-like components that allow a “page flip” navigation. Any content can be used, such as images or text. The plugin transforms the structure only when needed (i.e. when flipping a page) and uses some overlays as shadow for the pages to create more realism.","logo":"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/d3f0677c67787adf980523986b8b740b?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-org-420.png","name":"BookBlock","links":{"github":"https://github.com/codrops/BookBlock"},"tags":["jquery"]}
