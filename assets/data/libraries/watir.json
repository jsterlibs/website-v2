It is simple and flexible.\n\nWatir drives browsers the same way people do. It clicks links, fills in forms, presses buttons. Watir also checks results, such as whether expected text appears on the page.","logo":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Watir.gif","name":"Watir","links":{"site":"http://watir.com","github":"https://github.com/watir/watir"},"tags":["ruby"]}
