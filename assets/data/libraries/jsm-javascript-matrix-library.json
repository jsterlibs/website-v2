{"id":"jsm-javascript-matrix-library","description":"This library intends to provide an easy way to deal with nd-array. \n\nIts implementation has many advantages since it takes advantage of typed array which allow for fast computation and controlled memory consumption.\nThe design allows to work with real as well as complex values and is easy to use thanks to the object notation.\n\nMany modules are developed for ND-Array manipulation including:\nvalue selection and modifications ;\narithmetic and boolean operations ;\nlinear algebra ;\nimage processing, such as filtering, FFT, image matching ;\nstatistical processing ;\nand many others.\n\nThe inspiration is the well known Matlab software though there are some differences in the syntax we used.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"JSM - JavaScript Matrix library","links":{"site":"https://github.com/Etsitpab/JSM","github":"https://github.com/Etsitpab/JSM"},"tags":["image","javascript","math","matlab","matrix","numeric","processing","statistical"]}
