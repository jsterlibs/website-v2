{"id":"functional","description":"Functional is a library for functional programming in JavaScript. It defines the standard higher-order functions such as map, reduce (aka foldl), and select (aka filter). It also defines functions such as curry, rcurry, and partial for partial function application; and compose, guard, and until for function-level programming. And all these functions accept strings, such as 'x -> x+1', 'x+1', or '+1' as synonyms for the more verbose function(x) {return x+1}.","logo":"/images/repo.png","name":"Functional ","links":{"site":"http://osteele.com/sources/javascript/functional/"},"tags":[]}
