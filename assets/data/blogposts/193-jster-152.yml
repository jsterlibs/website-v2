  > 2020 and we're still coding JavaScript

  It's time for the monthly JSter again. [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/) is shaping up well and we're out of regular bird tickets for the conference soon. I've compiled a list of JavaScript links I've found interesting during the past month so please enjoy. I hope you find something useful.

  One of the things I completed during past month was [Sidewind](https://sidewindjs.com/). It's a light state manager built for JavaScript. State lives within the DOM and thanks to the modern web APIs I was able to keep it small. If you are using Tailwind for styling, Sidewind complements it well.
