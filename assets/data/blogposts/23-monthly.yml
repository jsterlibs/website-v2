  It was a busy month to put it mildly. You should see some of the results soon in a form of a sibling service.

  I provided an [interview at Pingdom's blog](http://royal.pingdom.com/2013/05/22/web-dev-projects/). Besides that I contributed a [guest post for gun.io](http://gun.io/blog/finding-javascript-libraries/). In this case the topic was "How do I find JavaScript libraries?" and you can probably guess which service was mentioned there amongst a few others.

  This will be the first time "Monthly JSter" will be available as [a newsletter](http://eepurl.com/zB_g5). So in case you came by this post by accident and are interested in this sort of content, do subscribe. Besides our montly one you might enjoy reading [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/). [HTML5 Weekly](http://html5weekly.com/) is somewhat excellent too. The lists have linked to us a couple of times. Thank you for that!

  I think I've bored you enough. Time to scavenge through [our Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/jsterlibs) and [blog archives](http://jster.net/blog). :)
