    My Webpack and React book reached [2.0.0-rc3](http://survivejs.com/blog/survivejs200-rc3/). Feedback still keeps on coming so I'm still working towards a final release. After that the work starts again, but with a different direction.

    If you want to ask me anything about Webpack or React, feel free to join my [AmA](https://github.com/survivejs/ama/issues) (Ask me Anything).
