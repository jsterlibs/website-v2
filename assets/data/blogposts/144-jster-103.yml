    > JavaScript, now.

    I spent roughly a week in Prague and wrote about my [experiences in WebExpo 2017](https://survivejs.com/blog/webexpo-2017/). In short, another great place in Europe to visit.

    In other news, we are going to organize [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/) at the end of April 2018 in Helsinki. The event will gather around three hundred React enthusiasts. We'll have a workshop day and two days for presentations in a single-track format.
