  > New year, new JavaScript libraries

  As a follow-up to [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/), we'll organize a new conference called [Future Frontend](https://futurefrontend.com/). As you might have guessed from the name, it is more future focused and the pivot allowed us to invite speakers that we otherwise couldn't have invited. The conference takes place 05-09.06 in Helsinki, Finland and we've started early sales.
