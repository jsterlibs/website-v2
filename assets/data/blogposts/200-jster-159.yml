  I recently [updated my webpack book to support webpack 5 initially](https://survivejs.com/blog/webpack-book-updated-to-webpack-5/). Webpack 5 will go out 10th of October so it's a good timing. During this work, I modernized the content heavily.

  [The second React Finland mini-conference about state management](https://react-finland.fi/blog/rf-2020-online-mini-conf-vol-2-recap/) took place a few days ago. [The next one](https://react-finland.fi/blog/rf-2020-online-mini-conf-vol-3/) will be about design systems and take place 22nd of September.
