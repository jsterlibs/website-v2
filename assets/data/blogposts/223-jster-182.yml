  It's time another JSter post. If you follow through [the mailing list](https://buttondown.email/jster), then you'll notice the mail looks different now. That's because I moved to a service called Buttondown to simplify my workflow.

  As a result, I might move back to a biweekly interval maybe in the fall as now it's simply faster to author the posts.
