    Two weeks have gone again. I released a new major version of my [table component for React](http://reactabular.js.org). The tree API has solidified and there are also a few goodies in store.

    webpack has been accepted as a part of the [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/webpack). This means it's possible for individuals and companies to support the project now. You can read more about the scheme at the [related blog post](https://medium.com/webpack/sustaining-webpack-for-the-future-part-1-32bea7f9e8a2).

    webpack 2 documentation effort is going to the right direction as well and [the documentation MVP is nearing completion](https://medium.com/webpack/documentation-mvp-the-final-stretch-8b65f843f828#.1so9s2iz4).
