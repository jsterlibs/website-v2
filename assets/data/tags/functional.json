It is a fork of Coco which is in turn derived from CoffeeScript. Like those two it has a relatively straightforward mapping to JavaScript. LiveScript is Coco but much more compatible with CoffeeScript, more functional, and more feature rich. LiveScript aims for increased expressiveness and code beauty.\nWhile adding features to assist in functional style programming, LiveScript also deeply supports imperative and object oriented programming, and has an optional class system with inheritance, calls to super, and more.","logo":"https://github.com/downloads/gkz/LiveScript/logo.png","name":"LiveScript","links":{"site":"http://livescript.net","github":"https://github.com/gkz/LiveScript"},"tags":["coco","coffeescript","compiler","functional","livescript"]}}]
