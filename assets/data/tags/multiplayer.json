Server-side logic compiles to JS and runs on Node.js, for games that require multiplayer.\n\nRendering in Flash uses Stage3D, falling back to copyPixels if hardware accelerated Stage3D isn't available. The HTML5 renderer uses canvas, with plans for WebGL support later on","logo":"https://raw.github.com/aduros/flambe/master/tools/embedder/logo.png","name":"Flambe","links":{"site":"https://github.com/aduros/flambe/wiki","github":"https://github.com/aduros/flambe"},"tags":["multiplayer"]}}]
