It brings your uploads to the next level with Multiple File Selection, Upload Progress and Client-side File Size Checking.\n\nUnlike other Flash upload tools, SWFUpload leaves the UI in the developer's hands. Using a set of event handlers developers can display upload progress and status to the user in their own HTML/CSS UI.\n\nSWFUpload has been featured in such projects as YouTube and WordPress.","logo":"https://code.google.com/p/swfupload/logo?cct=1354636663","name":"SWFUpload ","links":{"site":"https://code.google.com/p/swfupload/"},"tags":["Adobe","Player","api","file","files","flash","swf","upload","uploads"]}}]
