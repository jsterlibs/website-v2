However, generally speaking, audio still sucks. Thankfully, Google decided to create Web Audio API and make all our lives easier. The problem is that only the latest browsers support this new-fangled browser audio, so what are we to do?\n\nWe were presented with this very question while developing our new HTML5 game and set out to find a library that provided the functionality we needed, without all of the bloat, while still supporting the majority of browsers. Unfortunately, we didn't find anything that met our needs. So, we decided to create our own library and open source it. This library works great for games, but it can work just as well for any other audio-related web app.","logo":"https://github-camo.global.ssl.fastly.net/7a67c2205dba547f08e590a8c7d5d6c452f72ea2/687474703a2f2f676f6c646669726573747564696f732e636f6d2f70726f6a2f686f776c65726a732f686f776c65726a735f6c6f676f2e706e67","name":"howler.js","links":{"site":"http://howlerjs.com","github":"https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js"},"tags":["audio","mp3","music"]}}]
