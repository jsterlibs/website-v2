It is lightweight and more powerful in terms of out-of-the-box features than the existing SVG/VML based components on the market including Raphaël and Bonsai.\n\nKey features of GraphicsJS making it stand out:\n- Virtual DOM for drawing rapidly and only what is necessary.\n- Smart layering, with z-index.\n- Clear and concise JavaScript API, with chaining.\n- Powerful line drawing, not only Bezier curves but also any lines, shapes, arcs, etc. out of the box.\n- Rich text features, with multiline text support, text measurement, wrap, indent, spacing, align, etc.\n- Full accessibility (Section 508).\n- Legacy browser support (IE6+).\n- Its own transformation engine.\n\nGraphicsJS was developed and previously used as the core graphics engine for AnyChart's commercial charting libraries – AnyChart, AnyMap, AnyStock, and AnyGantt. With that said, it is already employed to operate data visualization for Oracle, Microsoft, Volkswagen, AT&T, Samsung, BP, Bosch, Merck, Reuters, Bank of China, Lockheed Martin, and thousands of other prominent AnyChart's customers including more than 70% of the Fortune 1000 companies.\n\nInteractive data visualization is just one of numerous potential use cases for the powerful GraphicsJS library. It can be utilized to build absolutely any graphics-related patterns and solutions including stunning, animated pictures, cartoons, infographics, mind maps, and so on.","logo":"http://www.anychart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/graphicsjs_icon_.jpg","name":"GraphicsJS","links":{"site":"http://www.graphicsjs.org","github":"https://github.com/anychart/graphicsjs"},"tags":["animation","graphics","html5","javascript","svg","vml"]}},{"title":"GameClosure","url":"/library/gameclosure","id":"gameclosure","library":{"id":"gameclosure","description":"Open Source JavaScript game SDK for iOS, Android and Web.
